This means a pen can last anywhere from 6 to 17 days, and will last longer at the start of your treatment. To start with, you’ll need up to 3 pens per month. Once you reach the 3mg maintenance dose, each pen will last 6 days, which means 5 pens will contain a month’s supply.Oral medication can be requested in courses of up to three months at a time.",

    "answer": "This extra liquid leftover in your pen is not meant for use, but is included to ensure the pen can deliver the correct dose every time. Weight loss pens, like those for Semaglutide or Tirzepatide, are carefully calibrated to leave a small amount of unused medication in the pen after the final dose. This ensures the mechanism works reliably and that you receive the full, accurate dose prescribed by your doctor.Attempting to extract this leftover medication can interfere with the device’s design and compromise both your safety and the effectiveness of the treatment. Always use your pen as instructed and dispose of it safely after completing the prescribed doses.",

    "question": "What if I have lost or misused a dose?",
    "answer": "If you lose or misuse a dose of your Mounjaro or Wegovy injection, you have two options:Option 1: Ideally, you should use each dose for at least 4 weeks before moving to the next one. We recommend getting the same dose again and continuing with another pen for another 4 weeks. There's no harm in staying on a lower dose longer than 4 weeks. Many people do this to allow any side effects to settle.Option 2: If you don’t want to stay on the same dose and have not had any side effects, you can consider moving up to the next dose after your 3 doses are finished. However, this is not the recommended use of the pen and may cause more side effects at higher doses.If you lose or misuse more than one dose, you should order another pen of the same dose to continue for at least 4 weeks in total. We do not recommend moving up to the next dose if you've had fewer than 3 doses at your current level.If you lose or misuse a dose of your Nevolat injection you have 2 options:Option 1: Ideally, you should use each dose for at least 1 week before moving to the next one. We recommend getting the same dose again and continuing with another pen for another week. There's no harm in staying on a lower dose longer than a week. Many people do this to allow any side effects to settle.Option 2: If you don’t want to stay on the same dose and have not had any side effects, you can consider moving up to the next dose after your first 3 doses are finished. However, this is not the recommended use of the pen and may cause more side effects at the higher dose.If you lose or misuse more than one dose, you should order another pen of the same dose to continue for at least 1 week in total. We do not recommend moving up to the next dose if you've had fewer than 3 doses at your current level.If you’ve given yourself too much Nevolat, then take a gap of up to 2 days before having another injection at the correct dose.

    "question": "What is erectile dysfunction?",
    "answer": "Erectile dysfunction is a medical term used to describe erection problems. You may have erectile dysfunction if you are unable to get an erection. You may also find that you are unable to keep an erection long enough to have sex, this is called ‘impotence’.Erectile dysfunction is a very common experience – over half (52%) of men aged 40 to 70 report erectile problems, and it affects over a quarter of younger men in the UK. Several factors can cause erectile dysfunction. Sometimes, there’s a physical cause, such as: blood vessel issuesalcohol consumptionneurological conditionsdrug useinjuryOther times, there’s a psychological cause, such as stress or anxiety. For many men, they may be experiencing erectile dysfunction due to a combination of these factors. Having problems getting an erection from time to time isn’t usually a cause for concern. If it continues, it can be stressful, affect your confidence, and contribute to relationship issues. Sometimes, identifying and treating the underlying cause is enough to help you get better erections. There are also erectile dysfunction tablets available to help you get and maintain an erection, regain confidence, and help you have better sex.”If you’ve been unable to get or keep erections, you’re not the only one. Millions of people worldwide have used erectile dysfunction treatments and seen the benefits. There is no reason to hold back from requesting erectile dysfunction treatments when they may be able to help you to have a more satisfying sex life. For some people, it can help to order online, as there’s no need for a face-to-face appointment, though your GP can help too.” – Dr Brenda Ikeji, Medical Editor.",

    "question": "How does erectile dysfunction treatment work?",
    "answer": "Most medical treatments for ED work by improving blood flow to the penis, making it easier to get and maintain an erection when aroused. Treatments like oral tablets, creams, and injections support the natural process of an erection by helping the muscles in the penis relax, allowing more blood to flow in and stay trapped inside. Other forms of treatment work differently. For example, vacuum pumps work by physically drawing blood into the penis to create an erection. If your ED is linked to psychological causes, therapies such as counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can also help. Can erectile dysfunction come back after treatment?Yes, erectile dysfunction can come back after treatment as this only helps you get an erection after you take it. This is why it is important to identify or rule out any underlying physical causes, like diabetes or heart disease. In some cases, there are emotional causes of erectile dysfunction, such as anxiety or depression. Treatment for erectile dysfunction can help in the short term, but it may be worth seeking psychological support to resolve the root cause. In many cases, erectile dysfunction can be temporary.",

    "question": "What erectile dysfunction treatments are there?",
    "answer": "There are lots of erectile dysfunction treatments available, including well-known branded pills like Viagra and generic versions like sildenafil. There are also a range of other options available, like creams, injections, penis pumps, and rings. Erectile dysfunction pillsThere are several medications available to treat erectile dysfunction that come in the form of a tablet or pill. They belong to a medication group called phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and work by blocking the enzyme PDE-5 (in the spongy part of the penis) where the blood vessels are located. This allows the muscles to relax and increases blood flow to the penis, so you can get an erection when aroused.PDE-5 inhibitors are usually the first-line choice for erectile dysfunction. Clinical trials have shown that PDE-5 inhibitors like sildenafil, tadalafil, avanafil, and vardenafil are effective for 60 to 70% of the population.PDE-5 inhibitors are usually taken by mouth, with or without food, 30 to 60 minutes before you intend to have sex. There’s also daily ED pills that you take every day, so you’re always ready. For them to work effectively, you will need to be aroused as they do not work on their own. They are also more effective when you drink minimal alcohol and, if you are going to take them with food, a light meal is recommended.Erectile dysfunction treatment creamThere are creams available that are applied directly into the penis. The active ingredient, alprostadil, is a type of vasodilator which works to widen the blood vessels in the penis, increasing blood flow, and making it easier to get an erection.Vitaros cream is one example and usually works within 5 to 30 minutes. It’s applied into the head of the penis using the provided applicator. Clinical trials have shown that alprostadil cream significantly improves erectile function in up to 83% of men. Erectile dysfunction injectionsCaverject or alprostadil injections contain the same active ingredient as erectile dysfunction creams (alprostadil) and work by opening up the blood vessels in the penis, helping you to get an erection. The first time you use these injections, you’ll be shown how to do it by a nurse at a clinic. Once you’ve learned how, it’s easy to do it yourself at home. The injection is inserted into the base of the penis and you should be able to get an erection within 10 minutes. When injections are used, an erection should last around 45 minutes.Vacuum pump for erectile dysfunctionVacuum pumps are medical devices that can improve erection quality. There are different types of pumps available. Some use air to create a vacuum causing blood to rush to the penis while others use water. Some pumps use a combination of air and water like the Vaxaid V7 Deluxe.Penis pumps can also be used in combination with other treatments, such as Viagra or sildenafil. They are also a good medication-free alternative for men who don’t want to take medication or do not respond to other erectile dysfunction treatments.",

    "question": "What’s the best treatment for erectile dysfunction?",
    "answer": "The best erectile dysfunction treatment for you will depend on your circumstances. For example, you may prefer one treatment over the other, or there may be medical reasons why you cannot use certain options. For example, sometimes, one treatment won’t work for you, but another will. Generally, the most effective treatments are oral medications that increase blood flow to the penis, such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and Levitra (vardenafil). These are often the first-line erectile dysfunction treatment for most people, but your doctor can discuss which treatment is most suitable for you.",

    "question": "Can erectile dysfunction be cured?",
    "answer": "In some cases, erectile dysfunction is temporary and can be reversed by making healthier lifestyle choices, treating underlying health problems, or making changes to medications causing erectile dysfunction as a side effect.Erectile dysfunction can be prevented long-term by identifying and resolving the underlying cause of the issue. For example, erections can be affected by a condition called atherosclerosis (a buildup of fats, cholesterol, and other substances in and on the artery walls). For this, your doctor may advise changing your diet, losing weight, increasing exercise, and prescribing medication to treat it. These steps may help to improve your erectile function long-term.Overall, erectile dysfunction treatments are effective and allow many people to have a healthy sex life. They are usually safe to use long-term, so even if it’s not possible to improve erections through methods like lifestyle changes, they can still be relied on.",

    "question": "What is the difference between Cialis and Viagra?",
    "answer": "The main difference between Cialis and Viagra lies in the time frame during which they are effective:Cialis works for a period of up to 36 hours. This means that if you are sexually stimulated within this period of time, Cialis will help you get an erection. It is often referred to as a “weekend pill”, as it allows you to have spontaneous sex several times during the specified window of time.Viagra is effective for up to 4 hours and therefore requires that you plan ahead.Both Viagra and Cialis take 30 to 60 minutes to work, so you should take the tablet at least half an hour before intercourse.The dosage for each medication is also different, as the active ingredient is different. Viagra comes in 25mg, 50mg, and 100mg tablets, whilst Cialis comes in 10mg or 20mg tablets. You can also get Cialis Daily, which is a 2.5mg or 5mg tablet you take once a day.",

There is no ‘better’ treatment as they both have different benefits depending on the person and their needs.For example, if you need a longer-lasting treatment, Cialis may be the better treatment for you as it lasts for up to 36 hours. If you need a treatment that’s available over the counter, Viagra Connect might be better for you. What’s important is learning the differences and finding what’s best for you.There is a large range of ED treatments available at ZAVA.

Eating a meal that’s high in fat right before taking your medication can make it take longer to start working.A few uncommon side effects of Cialis are stomach ache, nausea (feeling sick), or vomiting (being sick).

Factors such as underlying health conditions and tolerance to the ingredients can affect how your body responds to these medications.If you are taking the maximum dosage of one of these medications and would like to switch, you should always start with the recommended starting dosage (10mg for Cialis, 50mg for Viagra) to see how your body responds to the new medication, and then increase the dosage if necessary with guidance from your doctor.",

If you get side effects such as dizziness, blurred vision, heart palpitations, or confusion, this may be a sign of low blood pressure, and you should speak to your doctor straight away if you get these symptoms and stop taking Cialis.You should not take Cialis if you have been diagnosed with low blood pressure already, as this could cause your blood pressure to drop dangerously low.",

    "question": "Is Cialis Daily better than Viagra?",
    "answer": "Cialis Daily and Viagra are both popular treatments for erectile dysfunction that are effective for most men. While they work in similar ways, they have differences in how often you take them, how quickly they start to work, and how long they last. These differences may make one option more suitable for you, depending on your preferences.If you are having sex frequently or spontaneously, Cialis Daily can be a better option as you don’t need to plan to take your pill before you want to have sex. You just take one every day, and the effects are always working, whereas with Viagra you need to take it about an hour before you plan to have sex. Cialis Daily also works out cheaper than Viagra if you are having sex more than 2 to 3 times per week.On the other hand, Viagra may be more suitable if you aren’t having sex frequently. If you don’t have sex most days, then only having to take Viagra when you need it can be a more convenient and affordable option.Can’t take Viagra or not sure if it’s the right ED treatment for you?

Levitra is available in 10mg tablets or 20mg tablets. Your doctor is likely to prescribe Levitra 10mg tablets first for you. But if you find this doesn’t have the desired effects, they can increase the dose to Levitra 20mg.

    "question": "How does Levitra work?",
    "answer": "Levitra works by increasing blood flow to your penis, making it easier to get and keep an erection during sex.It contains the active ingredient vardenafil, which belongs to a group of medications called phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE-5). PDE-5 inhibitors work by reducing the action of PDE-5, a natural chemical in your body which causes blood vessels in the penis to constrict. By inhibiting PDE-5, Levitra relaxes these blood vessels, allowing for increased blood flow to the penis when you are aroused.",

    "question": "Levitra vs Viagra",
    "answer": "Levitra and Viagra are both PDE-5 inhibitors and work in similar ways, but they have some key differences. Vardenafil, which is the active ingredient in Levitra, is almost 10 times more biochemically potent than sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra. This is why Levitra pills are available in lower doses (typically 10mg or 20mg) compared to Viagra (which typically comes in 50mg and 100mg doses), although it doesn’t mean Levitra is ‘stronger’ than sildenafil medications.

    "question": "Levitra vs. Cialis",
    "answer": "Levitra and Cialis are two different types of erectile dysfunction medication. Both work by relaxing the blood vessels, and increasing blood flow to the penis. This, alongside sexual arousal, can help you achieve and sustain an erection long enough for sex.. Different types of erectile dysfunction medication will work differently for different people.The main difference between Levitra and Cialis is that Cialis can last longer (up to 36 hours). Some may prefer to use Cialis because it requires less planning – you don’t have to remember to take it 30 minutes before you hope to have sex. Cialis is also available in lower daily doses that you take every day, allowing you to be ready for sex at any time.However, the downside is that the side effects of Cialis will also last longer. Men who often notice they get side effects from ED medication may find Cialis causes them more problems than Levitra.

This is because your blood pressure can drop too low as a result.A doctor will check that sildenafil is safe for you by asking you about any medical conditions you have or medications you’re taking before prescribing it for you. If you request sildenafil through ZAVA, one of our doctors will check this as part of your online consultation.",

    "question": "How does Spedra work?",
    "answer": "Spedra works by relaxing the muscles in the penis, this increases blood flow, helping you to stay hard and maintain an erection. Spedra does not just give you an erection, you’ll need to be sexually aroused for it to work. “Spedra does not cure erectile dysfunction or any underlying conditions that may cause it. It can, however, treat your symptoms so you can improve your sex life. You should still speak to your GP to find out the underlying cause of your erectile dysfunction. ED tablets like Spedra can be used in the meantime when you need them, as long as a healthcare professional has checked that the medication is safe for you to take.” – Dr Zoe Miller, Medical Editor. How long does Spedra last?Spedra usually lasts for 4 to 6 hours. This doesn’t mean that you’ll have an erection that lasts for 4 to 6 hours, but the medication can help you get an erection during this time frame.How long does Spedra take to work?Spedra is the fastest-working erectile dysfunction medication, getting to work in as little as 15 minutes, compared to 30 to 60 minutes with other erectile dysfunction medications.How effective is SpedraSpedra is an effective erectile dysfunction treatment, and clinical trials have shown that this medication can help up to 59% of men get an erection hard enough to have sex with. How effective Spedra is for you will depend on many things, such as: how suitable it is for you whether you’re sexually arousedif you’ve drunk alcohol if you’ve eaten a large meal before taking itNote that alcohol and heavy meals can delay the effects of Spedra or make it less effective. “When trying Spedra, we recommend using it on 8 different occasions before deciding the treatment is not working for you. It can sometimes take time for a new ED treatment to work as your body needs to adjust. Things like confidence issues and nervousness can also mean it takes a few attempts to be effective. Don’t take Spedra more than once per day. Speak to your doctor if you’ve tried it 8 times and you’re still not able to get an erection hard enough or keep it long enough for sex.” – Dr Zoe Miller, Medical Editor.",

However, they contain different active ingredients. Viagra contains sildenafil while Spedra contains avanafil. Both Spedra and Viagra can last for 4 to 6 hours but Spedra works quicker, with some patients getting an erection in as little as 15 minutes. So, if you’re looking for a fast-acting erectile dysfunction medication, Spedra may be a more appropriate choice.Research also shows that avanafil causes fewer significant reductions in blood pressure than sildenafil: 15% compared to 29%.Spedra vs tadalafilTadalafil (also sold under the brand name Cialis) is a PDE-5 inhibitor like Spedra but it works slightly differently. Although Spedra can help you get an erection in 15 to 30 minutes, compared to 30 to 60 minutes for tadalafil, the effects only last for around 4 hours. Tadalafil effects, on the other hand, last up to 36 hours, so may be more appropriate if you’re looking for a longer-lasting treatment.You can also try Cialis Daily, which is a lower daily dose of tadalafil that helps you get an erection at any time. And because it’s a daily pill, you don’t have to take it just before sex. This option is recommended if you have sex frequently (3 times or more a week).",

    "question": "What is premature ejaculation?",
    "answer": "Ejaculation is the release of semen from the penis, and usually happens when you orgasm. The process is controlled by the central nervous system. Your brain sends a signal to your reproductive organs, where the sperm moves from the testicles, combines with seminal fluid to make semen, and is ejected from the penis.When it happens more quickly than a man and his partner would like, it’s referred to as premature ejaculation (also known as early ejaculation, premature climax, or rapid ejaculation). It’s often present alongside erectile dysfunction and is classed as a sexual dysfunction.On average, men ejaculate after 5 and a half minutes of penetrative sexual intercourse. But this is very much an average as timing can range from 30 seconds to 30 minutes. International guidelines define premature ejaculation as coming within 1 minute of entering your partner. Many men experience occasional bouts of premature ejaculation. However, if it’s persistent, affecting your sex life, or causing anxiety for you or your partner, then you may wish to seek treatment.",

    "question": "What causes premature ejaculation?",
    "answer": "Psychological causes can include depression, stress, anxiety or relationship issues. More long term issues such as childhood trauma, a lack of confidence, or associating sexual activity with guilt can also play a part.Alternatively, premature ejaculation can be a result of recreational drug use, alcohol misuse, low serotonin levels, or an over or under active thyroid gland.Other physical causes can include diabetes (usually type 1 diabetes), a damaged spinal cord, multiple sclerosis, age, and bladder or prostate gland surgery.",

    "question": "What treatment options are available for premature ejaculation?",
    "answer": "Behavioural techniquesThere are some simple exercises that can help resolve the problem before opting for medical treatment.Weak pelvic floor muscles can affect the time it takes to climax. You can become familiar with it by stopping peeing midstream. When you have a spare moment, tighten these muscles for three seconds, then let go. Repeat this a few times. Try to work up three sets of ten repetitions a day. These are known as Kegel exercises.Try the stop and start technique, where you or your partner stimulates you to the point of climax. When you are about to come, pause and draw back from your orgasm. Repeat this three times, and complete the method a few times a week to build up your control.The squeeze technique is similar, but after masturbating to near climax, either you or your partner squeezes the head of your penis, at the point where the head joins the shaft, for 10 to 20 seconds. The urge to ejaculate will subside, at which point you start again. Repeat 3 times, and complete the method a few times a week to help build resilience.Other physical techniques include masturbating an hour or two before sex, using a condom in order to lessen sensation, or to have sex in a position that allows your partner to slow things down more readily.Sex TherapyIf you suspect your condition may be caused by stress, performance anxiety, or worries related to relationships or sex, counselling can be an effective tool to help delay ejaculation. Sessions are available on the NHS, or you may choose to pay privately. The counselling service Relate also offers sex and behavioural therapy.The approach will involve you, and perhaps your sexual partner, speaking to a non-judgemental sex therapist about ways to resolve the problem, and identifying any deeper, underlying causes. Premature ejaculation can cause or be caused by relationship issues, so talking therapies are often helpful. Sex therapists are well versed in ejaculation problems, and can also outline physical techniques that might be used to help delay ejaculation.SSRIsSome serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants such as paroxetine, sertraline and fluoxetine delay ejaculation and can be prescribed to treat premature ejaculation. You will be expected to take a course, and the full effects should be noticeable in 1 or 2 weeks. SSRIs can also tackle depression, another root cause of premature ejaculation. Priligy, or dapoxetine, is a prescription-only selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) developed for treating PE. It acts much faster than those mentioned above, and should be taken only when required, but not more than once a day. It is not recommended for those with heart, kidney or liver problems and can interact with other medicines. You will need to speak to a doctor or healthcare professional to get a prescription.EMLAEMLA is a topical numbing or anaesthetic cream, which is available over the counter, and works by desensitising the penis. It should be applied to the head of the penis and shaft up to 30 minutes before sex. It should be washed off after it has decreased sensation in the penis, in order to avoid loss of erection and to prevent numbness affecting your partner. Anaesthetic creams can be most effective when used with a condom. Other anaesthetic treatments include lidocaine or prilocaine sprays, also available over the counter.",

    "question": "How to use EMLA cream for premature ejaculation",
    "answer": "To use EMLA cream, follow these steps:Wash your hands thoroughly.Apply a pea sized amount of EMLA cream to the shaft and the head of the penis (glans) roughly 15 to 20 minutes before sex. You do not need to rub the cream in, just put a layer of it onto the penis.Wash your hands thoroughly after application to prevent the cream from affecting your hands. You can leave it for up to 60 minutes if you do not notice any reduced sensation. Wash off the cream from your penis before you have sex. This will stop the cream from affecting your partner. If you do not feel the cream is working, you can apply it to a slightly wider area. Your doctor can give you personalised advice about how to apply the cream for PE. When using EMLA cream, you should avoid:using it on an open wound (sore or cut)using large amounts or over a large area of skin – too much anaesthetic could be absorbed into your blood, which could be dangerousit coming into contact with your eyes If you get EMLA cream in your eyes, this can cause a corneal abrasion, which is a superficial scratch at the front of your eye (cornea).

    "question": "Psychological therapy for premature ejaculation",
    "answer": "Sometimes other factors like confidence, anxiety, or depression can get in the way of sex – this is completely normal. You might feel as though you are anxious to perform in bed, or you might be having trouble in your relationship. In this case, you should communicate with your partner. You can also have behavioural and psychological therapy, which are non-drug treatments for premature ejaculation. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist for more information on psychological therapy.Lifestyle changes for premature ejaculationPhysical factors can affect your sex life in the same way that psychological factors might. So, making small lifestyle changes may also help you manage premature ejaculation. We recommend changes such as: Stopping smokingA study has found that smoking can sometimes contribute to premature ejaculation. This is because smoking creates changes in the blood flow and hormones, disrupting the process of ejaculation. Stopping smoking can improve this. DietThere is limited medical research on the relationship between diet and premature ejaculation, though some clinical studies have found that deficiencies in certain vitamins are linked to worsening cases of PE. In particular, low levels of vitamin D, which is found in sunlight, milk, eggs, and oily fish like salmon and sardines. Other studies have found that low levels of folic acid (found in dark green leafy vegetables, legumes, citrus fruits, and nuts) can also contribute to the development of PE. Adjusting your diet alongside medication may improve premature ejaculation. We recommend reducing your intake of: sugary foods and drinks (fizzy drinks and chocolate)excessive saturated and trans fats (fried foods, crisps, cakes, pies, and pastries)AlcoholAlcohol can affect sexual function, with 72% of alcohol dependent men experiencing sexual dysfunction, the most common being premature ejaculation. So, cutting down your alcohol intake may improve premature ejaculation. Regular exercise Regular, light exercise can help with premature ejaculation and ejaculation control. Clinical studies have found regular exercise as a potential way to treat premature ejaculation, alongside medication, including: yoga runningswimmingYou can also try targeted exercises, which can strengthen your pelvic floor muscles, such as Kegel exercises. Weight loss Weight loss has been clinically found to significantly improve premature ejaculation. There is a range of weight loss treatments available, which include lifestyle changes or weight loss medications. If you’re unsure if your weight is causing or worsening your premature ejaculation, you should speak to your doctor. You can also check your body mass index (BMI) with our BMI calculator, where you can also find out what a healthy BMI is. Making lifestyle changes is also complementary to treatments like EMLA. If you have any specific questions about lifestyle changes that may be more suitable for you to make, speak to your doctor, and they should be able to provide you with personalised advice.",

    "question": "What causes hair loss in men?",
    "answer": "GeneticsThe most common cause of hair loss is genetics. Male pattern baldness, or androgenetic alopecia, is hereditary and affects around 50% of men by the age of 50 and up to 80% by the age of 70. This type of hair loss typically presents as a receding hairline or thinning at the crown. Doctors often use the Hamilton-Norwood scale to assess the type and severity of male pattern baldness.Genetics influence how sensitive your hair follicles are to a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that your body naturally produces. Higher sensitivity to DHT can increase the shrinking of hair follicles, leading to finer and lighter hair until they stop producing hair altogether. DHT blockers are a common treatment for managing this type of hair loss.MedicationsCertain medications can cause hair loss as a side effect. These include:blood thinnersantidepressantsbeta-blockerschemotherapy drugshormonal medicationsretinoidsJust because a medication lists hair loss as a side effect doesn’t mean you will experience it. Hair loss due to medications is often temporary and usually reverses after discontinuing the treatment. If you think your medication is causing hair loss, it’s always a good idea to speak to your doctor about it. They can help you work out the cause and advise you if needed.Health conditionsSome health conditions can also lead to hair loss. Alopecia areataThis is an autoimmune disease that causes bald patches throughout the body. AnaemiaAnaemia happens when there aren’t enough haemoglobin or red blood cells in your blood, causing low iron levels. This can prevent hair follicles from getting the nutrients and oxygen they need, leading to hair loss.LupusLupus can cause inflammation throughout the body and your scalp. When this happens, hair loss can occur.Thyroid disordersHaving a thyroid disorder or/and an imbalance of thyroid hormones can lead to hair loss or thinning hair.Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)PCOS is a hormonal condition that can lead to thinning hair and male-pattern hair loss in women. In some cases it can also increase hair growth in other places than the scalp. Scalp infectionAny type of infection on your scalp, whether fungal, bacterial, or viral, can lead to hair loss.Kidney diseaseKidney disease can lead to protein and vitamin deficiencies, which can cause hair loss.Vitamin deficienciesLack of Vitamin B12 or D can lead to hair thinning.You should speak to your doctor if you notice sudden or severe hair loss. Hair loss caused by health conditions can often be treated by fixing the condition causing it. Your doctor can help identify if a condition is causing your hair loss and help manage it.StressSevere stress can trigger temporary hair loss. This usually occurs three months after a stressful event. This condition, known as telogen effluvium, often resolves once stress levels decrease.It’s important to try to reduce your stress levels if you can, especially if it’s causing hair loss, but we understand it’s often easier said than done. If you’re struggling with stress, try:breathing exercises and meditationeating well-balanced, healthy mealsgetting more sleeplimiting or avoiding alcoholtaking walks and spending more time in naturetalking to a doctor or reaching out to friends and familySee the NHS’s website for more advice on managing stress.StylingExcessive use of harsh chemicals, tight hairstyles or heat tools (like straighteners) can weaken hair strands and lead to hair loss. Go for gentler styling methods to reduce damage and protect your hair.Dos:Use heat protection sprays if using heat tools like straighteners or curling irons.Allow hair to air dry whenever possible.Try loose hairstyles that don’t pull on your scalp.Use sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners to reduce irritation.Regularly trim split ends to prevent further hair damage.Choose natural or gentle dyes if colouring your hair.Don’ts:Wear tight hairstyles like braids or ponytails that pull on the scalp. Use heat tools (like straighteners) daily.Apply bleach or other harsh chemicals excessively or regularly. Wash your hair too much, as it can strip natural oils.Comb or brush wet hair aggressively, as it’s more prone to breakage.By following these steps, you can reduce the risk of styling-related hair loss and maintain healthier hair.",

    "question": "What are the common signs of hair loss in men?",
    "answer": "The most common signs of hair loss in men are usually:Receding hairline – Hair starts thinning around the temples, often progressing into a defined M-shape pattern.Thinning crown – A noticeable bald spot on the top of the head that may gradually expand over time.Widening parting – The scalp becomes more visible along the parting line, which may indicate more extensive thinning.Shedding – Excess hair falling out when brushing, washing, or even during normal daily activities. It is common to lose a little hair while doing these activities. Shedding applies to losing significantly more than you do naturally.How do I know if my hair loss is male pattern baldness or something else?You can usually spot male pattern baldness as it often follows a predictable pattern, as outlined by the Hamilton-Norwood scale. Common signs include a receding hairline, thinning crown, or widening parting. However, other conditions can mimic these symptoms:Alopecia Areata – Sudden patchy bald spots rather than a consistent pattern.Telogen Effluvium – Thinning across the scalp rather than localised areas.Scalp Infections – Symptoms like redness, flaking, or blisters may accompany hair loss.Nutritional Deficiencies – You may notice brittle or thinning hair with no specific pattern.Male pattern baldness usually develops over a long period, whereas other conditions may cause more sudden hair loss. If you notice sudden shedding, patchiness, or other unusual symptoms, it’s essential to speak to a doctor. A physical examination, blood tests, or a scalp biopsy can help identify the underlying cause.",

However, other conditions like alopecia areata, scalp infections, or telogen effluvium may require a different approach or treatment. Consulting your doctor can help confirm the diagnosis and they should recommend suitable treatment options.",

    "question": "How is hair loss treated?",
    "answer": "How you treat your hair loss depends on the type of hair loss you have and its cause. It will also depend on what treatment best suits you.Hair loss tabletsFinasteride – This prescription-only medication works by reducing DHT levels in the scalp. By lowering DHT, finasteride limits further hair loss and encourages regrowth in areas affected by male pattern baldness. It typically takes 3 to 6 months to see noticeable improvements, with the most visible results after 12 months of consistent use. Studies show that finasteride is effective in over 80% of men with male pattern baldness.Propecia – A branded version of finasteride with the same active ingredient and efficacy. Like finasteride, Propecia requires a prescription and regular use to achieve and maintain results.Hair loss shampoosAlpecin – Alpecin contains caffeine, which may help stimulate hair follicles and improve hair density. While its effectiveness is debated, it is often used as a treatment alongside medications like finasteride.Topical TreatmentsMinoxidil – Minoxidil is available over-the-counter or by prescription, and it is applied directly to the scalp. It works by increasing blood flow to hair follicles, stimulating hair growth. Minoxidil is most effective for younger men or those in the early stages of hair loss. Results can take 3-6 months, and continued use is necessary to maintain progress. It is also used to treat androgenic alopecia.Wigs and hair systemsWigs and hair systems are a non-surgical option for people experiencing significant or total hair loss. Wigs are available in synthetic or natural hair and can be tailored to match your style preferences. Hair systems are a semi-permanent option directly attached to the scalp and usually provide a more natural look. Both options are ideal for people looking for an immediate and reversible answer to hair loss.Hair transplantsHair transplants involve surgically moving hair follicles from one part of the scalp (usually the back or sides) to areas with thinning or no hair. This is a long-term solution for hair loss but requires recovery time. This option can also be very expensive and comes with its own set of risks.Scalp micropigmentation (SMP)SMP is a cosmetic tattooing procedure that mimics the look of a shaved head or fuller hair. It involves injecting tiny dots of pigment into the scalp to look like hair follicles. This option is effective for people with complete hair loss or thinning who want to create the illusion of density.Lifestyle and nutritional adjustmentsIn some cases, improving diet and reducing stress can support overall hair health. Ensuring a diet rich in vitamins and minerals like Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, iron, and zinc can promote stronger hair growth. Managing stress through mindfulness, exercise, and adequate sleep can also help reduce temporary hair loss.",

You can then choose to collect your treatment or get it delivered with next dayNext Day delivery.Over-the-counter optionsThere are over-the-counter options available to help with hair loss, but they may not be as effective as the prescription options. These treatments can include certain shampoos (Alpecin) and topical options (Regaine). However, medications like finasteride require a prescription from your doctor and so can not legally be sold over the counter.Can I get hair loss treatment on the NHS?The NHS does not offer treatments for male pattern baldness. You will need to get a private prescription for treatment, which you can get from an NHS doctor, or from other private healthcare or online doctor services. A private prescription means you will pay full price for your treatment, rather than the standard NHS prescription charges (which may be free for some people).",

  {
    "question": "How does Propecia work?",
    "answer": "Propecia works by lowering the levels of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which causes hair to thin and not regrow when it naturally falls out. The active ingredient in Propecia, which is called finasteride, blocks the enzyme which converts testosterone to DHT,lowering the levels of DHT in your body. This treats male pattern baldness by slowing down and stopping further hair loss, and promoting regrowth.How effective is Propecia? Propecia has been clinically proven to be effective in preventing hair loss for 90% of men who use it. How long does Propecia take to work? Propecia starts working immediately but you will only see results after 3 to 6 months.Propecia requires long-term use.Does Propecia work for a receding hairline? Yes, Propecia can slow hair loss and help thicken and even regrow hair on the hairline. However, this is not possible if you have already lost the hair follicles in this area.Can Propecia regrow hair? Yes, Propecia can help to regrow hair in some men if you still have functioning hair follicles. However, Propecia is most effective at slowing down hair loss, rather than regrowing it. It cannot help regrow your hair if you are completely bald, or if the hair follicles in areas such as your crown or hairline are inactive. Does Propecia thicken hair? Yes, Propecia can help to thicken hair.. DHT causes your hair follicles to shrink, making your hair thinner and weaker. By lowering the levels of DHT in your body, Propecia can stop this process, leading to thicker, stronger, and healthier hair.",

    "question": "How to take Propecia",
    "answer": "You should take 1 Propecia tablet whole, once a day with water. You can take Propecia with or without food. You can take your Propecia tablet at any time in the day, but ideally at a similar time every day.How much Propecia to takeEach tablet contains the recommended 1 mg daily dosage of finasteride. Take the tablet once a day. If you forget to take a Propecia tablet you should skip that day and take your next tablet when it is due the following day.Do not take a double dose, it will not give you better results or make Propecia work faster.If you take more tablets than you should, speak to your doctor straight away.Can I take a higher dose for faster results? No, you cannot take a higher dose of Propecia for faster or better results. It will not make Propecia work more quickly and you will not see better results. If you take more than the recommended dosage you should speak to your doctor as this may mean you’re more likely to experience negative side effects. How long do you need to take Propecia for?Propecia is designed for long-term use. As a long-term treatment, its results are better when taken for several months or years. You may not see results until after 3 to 6 months.You may not want to take Propecia forever. Some research into the health risks of long-term finasteride use suggests that indefinite use of Propecia may not be ideal. At some point, you may feel ready to stop taking it. Male pattern hair loss is a common condition and, for many, a natural process as we age. But, if you are unhappy with your current rate of hair loss, Propecia is an effective option.What happens when I stop taking Propecia?If you stop taking Propecia you will return to losing your hair, usually within 6-12 months after stopping treatment. After Propecia has left your system the levels of DHT are no longer being suppressed, meaning your hair will begin to thin and fall out again.",

    "question": "Topical Propecia vs oral Propecia",
    "answer": "Propecia (finasteride) is also made as a topical medication, meaning it can be a cream or a spray used directly on the scalp. Topical finasteride may be safe for both men and women. However, it is not yet licensed for use in the UK. Early controlled trials suggest that topical finasteride (sprays or creams) show promising results for preventing hair loss.Another later study suggests that with finasteride sprays there is less likelihood of users experiencing the negative sexual side effects related to oral finasteride (Propecia tablets) such as reduced sex drive and erectile dysfunction because it’s applied directly to the scalp. However, this is disputed by research which found that topical finasteride does cause levels of DHT to decrease in the body and therefore may also cause negative sexual side effects, like oral finasteride. More research is required before topical finasteride is likely to be licensed in the UK by the Medicines & Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA). If topical Finasteride does become available, it may be a good alternative to Propecia tablets. However, you may find that oral Propecia, the daily tablet, is a simpler and less time-consuming option. Propecia vs minoxidilMinoxidil is a hair loss treatment that works differently to Propecia to help treat male pattern baldness. While Propecia slows down and stops hair loss by lowering levels of DHT, Minoxidil promotes hair growth by stimulating hair follicles to enter their growth phase.Because they work in different ways, it is safe to take Propecia and minoxidil together. This is commonly done as an effective combination to treat hair loss.Minodixil is also available without a prescription, so you are able to get it over the counter at most UK pharmacies. It can come in the form of tablets, but is more often sold as a topical solution that is applied directly to the scalp - such as shampoos, creams, foams, or ointments.Propecia vs dutasteridePropecia and Dutasteride are similar medications, and work to stop hair loss in the same way - by blocking the production of DHT. Clinical studies have shown that Dutasteride is more effective at blocking DHT than Propecia, but it is not currently licensed in the UK for treating hair loss.Other treatment optionsAlternatively, if you do not want to take medication for your hair loss, there are other treatment options which might be appropriate for some men, such as:tattooinghair follicle transplantsvitamin supplementswigssteroid cream or injections You can usually get these types of treatments privately but you may be able to access them on the NHS if you qualify for financial help, or if you have a medical condition.",

    "question": "How to switch pills",
    "answer": "If you’re not happy with your current contraceptive pill, switching pills is pretty straightforward. Talk to your doctor and let them know you want to switch pills. They may ask you some questions about your health and how you feel, and then switch you to a different form of birth control. You’ll typically need to take a pill for at least 3 months before you know if it's right for you, as your body needs some time to get used to the medication. It may be the case that you want to switch because you’re dealing with side effects, which may go away after around 3 months.",

Contraceptive pills can also cause irregular periods, as they are hormonal contraceptive pills. Usually there is no need to worry about irregular periods, as it is normal to have this from time to time. However, if you are having frequent irregular periods, speak to a doctor.",

This means it has a slightly stronger oestrogen effect, meaning a bigger impact on conditions like PMS and acne but also a higher chance of oestrogen-related side effects.",

    "question": "How to stop bleeding on Cerelle",
    "answer": "Some women experience irregular or breakthrough bleeding when taking Cerelle, and other contraceptive pills. This is because the pill causes hormonal changes, which can affect how much and how often you bleed. These changes usually happen in the first 3 months of taking Cerelle and should stop as your body gets used to these hormonal changes.If you’ve been taking Cerelle for longer than 3 months and are still experiencing irregular bleeding, or are concerned about how much or how often you’re bleeding when taking Cerelle in general, speak to your doctor.",

    "question": "Can I take Cerelle with HRT?",

HRT usually does not interact negatively with progesterone-only pills, so it is safe to take as long as it’s been prescribed by a doctor. You cannot take combined hormonal contraceptive pills alongside HRT, as they contain oestrogen.",

    "question": "Description",
    "answer": "Please note: Cilique is long-term out of stock. Consider alternative contraceptive pills like Lizinna instead.Cilique is a safe and 99% effective combined contraceptive pill which works to prevent pregnancy. It contains a combination of 2 synthetic versions of female hormones: oestrogen (35mcg ethinylestradiol) and progesterone (250mcg norgestimate). These ingredients work to stop you from getting pregnant by stopping ovulation, thinning the lining of your uterus to prevent an egg attaching and growing, and thickening cervical mucus to make it harder for sperm to reach the egg. Due to the combination of hormones in Cilique, in some cases it can treat hormone-related symptoms associated with PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), like heavy or irregular periods, and acne.Cilique is commonly taken for 21 days with a 7-day pill break. It comes in a strip of oral tablets, which you follow each day up until the strip ends. Once your break ends, you can move to the next one.",

  {
    "question": "How does Cilique work?",
    "answer": "Cilique contains ethinylestradiol (oestrogen) and norgestimate (progesterone) which work in combination to prevent pregnancy by: stopping the release of an egg (ovulation) thickening cervical mucus, which makes it difficult for sperm to travel through the womb thinning the lining of the uterus, so a fertilised egg would find it difficult to implant itselfDue to the changes of hormones as your body gets used to Cilique and how it works, you may also notice changes in your period. You may find that your period becomes reduced and therefore lighter, though in some cases people find that it can actually become heavier, or that it becomes more regular. The effects of Cilique can vary from person to person but combined pills have been commonly reported to provide relief from painful periods. Cilique may also help with acne, though if you have acne we also offer acne treatments available to request. How long does Cilique last?If you take Cilique as prescribed and follow the instructions in your patient information leaflet, it will remain active in your body to prevent pregnancy, even during your pill break. Cilique can take a few days to fully leave your system once you stop taking it, but your contraceptive protection will stop immediately, so you could get pregnant if you do not use another method of contraception. If you have been taking Cilique for a long time, it will take a few months for the hormones to regulate back to how they were before you began taking it. How long does Cilique take to work? If you start taking Cilique on days 1 to 5 of your period you will be immediately protected from pregnancy. If you start it any later than this you will need additional contraception like condoms for the first week (7 days) until Cilique is established and starts to work. How effective is Cilique? Cilique, like all combined contraceptives, is over 99% effective if you take it correctly. However, with typical use it is closer to 91% effective, such as if you miss pills, vomit, or have diarrhoea, or if you take other medications which can reduce its effectiveness.",

You should follow the direction of the arrows on the strip when taking Cilique. After you have taken your pill once a day for 21 days, you should have a 7-day break. During this time, you may experience a withdrawal bleed (like a period), which may not be completely finished as you start your next strip, though you should still start your next strip. During these 7 days you do not need to use extra contraception if you have correctly taken Cilique each day for 21 days.",

If you have taken more pills than you should have and you are concerned or experience side effects, contact your doctor or dial 111. What if I throw up after taking Cilique? If you throw up within 3 hours after taking your pill (or you have severe diarrhoea), it may not have fully absorbed which means that would make it a missed pill. Follow the guidance for a missed pill included within your patient information leaflet. We recommend taking another pill and using additional contraception if you continue to be ill, until you have taken the pill for 7 days without vomiting or having diarrhoea.",

Alternative combined oral contraceptive options include: Microgynon 30 – a 21-day pill containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrelRigevidon – a combined oral contraceptive which is also used to treat heavy or irregular periodsTriregol – another phasic pill meant to match the natural hormone changes during your menstrual cycleYasmin – a combined pill that contains different types of oestrogen (ethinylestradiol) and progestogen (drospirenone)Zoely – a 28-day pill, with 24 pills containing active ingredients (estradiol and nomegestrol acetate) while 4 are placebo and are there to help you remember your pill every dayCilique vs RigevidonThere is no difference between Cilique and Rigevidon’s effectiveness, both are 99% effective at preventing pregnancy if they’re taken correctly. Both pills also: are to be taken daily for 21 days before a 7 day breakcontain the same form of synthetic oestrogen, ethylestradiol Oestrogen levels Rigevidon contains less oestrogen (30mcg ethinylestradiol). Cilique contains 35mcg of ethinylestradiol, in comparison. So, if you think a combined pill seems more suited to your needs but would prefer a pill that contains less oestrogen, Rigevidon, compared to Cilique, could be an option. Cilique vs MicrogynonBoth Cilique and Microgynon are 99% effective at preventing pregnancy if taken correctly, they also: should be taken daily for 21 days with a 7 day break contain the same form of synthetic oestrogen, ethylestradiol Microgynon contains 5mcg less oestrogen (ethylestradiol), as Cilique contains 35mcg and Microgynon contains 30mcg. If you think a combined pill is suitable for you but experience more side effects with oestrogen, Microgynon could be a more suitable option compared to Cilique. If you are not sensitive to oestrogen, since Cilique has slightly more oestrogen, it may have more oestrogen-related benefits, like improvements to periods.The levonorgestrel in Microgynon has a stronger male hormone effect than the norgestimate in Cilique. This means it comes with a higher risk of side effects like acne. However, Microgynon will also have a bigger positive effect on things like the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.Contraceptive pill effects can vary from person to person. There are slight differences across the range of alternatives as there are varying amounts of hormones in each. This can impact hormonal changes resulting in positive or negative effects. Mini pillsIf you do not feel that the combined oral contraceptive is the best option for you, or if you are sensitive to oestrogen, or if you prefer not to take a pill that contains oestrogen, then the mini pill may be an option. The mini pill contains progesterone only. Mini pill options available at ZAVA include: NorgestonNoridayCerazetteCerelleFor more detailed guidance on contraceptive options available, check out our guide to contraceptive pill brands.",

    "question": "How to take Femodette",
    "answer": "Femodette comes in a strip marked with the days of the week, containing 21 pills. You should start to take Femodette on the first day of your cycle (the first day of your period). Most people choose to take 1 pill daily for 21 days on the correct day of the week, following the marked strip. After the 21 days, you should have a 7-day pill break (meaning you should take no pills during this time). During this break you may experience a withdrawal bleed, this is normal and is similar to a period but is likely to be less painful and lighter. After your pill break, you can start your next strip, even if you are still experiencing a withdrawal bleed. If you have taken your pills correctly and on time, you do not need to use contraception during your pill-free days. Other ways you can also take Femodette include: continuously – you can take Femodette continuously, without a pill-free break. tricycling – it is also safe to take Femodette without a 7-day break until you have finished the box of 3 strips. Once you have finished, you can take a 4-day break instead of a 7-day break before restarting the next one. This means you would bleed every 3 months (rather than each month). Tricycling might be right for you if you get symptoms such as period pain, premenstrual tension (PMT), migraine, and other headaches. Speak with your doctor if you have these side effects while taking the pill and think that tricycling might be a better way to take your contraceptive. You must follow the instructions of your doctor when taking Femodette to ensure it is effective, and refer to the patient information leaflet.How long do I need to take Femodette for? Take Femodette for as long as you would like to prevent pregnancy. Or, you can take Femodette for as long as you need to alleviate menstrual symptoms if your doctor has prescribed the pill to you for this reason. How long is it safe to take Femodette for? Taking Femodette long-term is safe, as long as a doctor agrees it is. Many people take Femodette without issue for years, but it is important to do an annual pill review with a doctor to make sure it’s still the right option for you. If things change with your health this medication may not be safe to continue and you should speak with your doctor, for example if you:develop migrainesget high blood pressureneed surgerybecome at risk of breast cancer or develop itYou should also get regular checkups when called for them by your GP, such as cervical smear tests and breast screenings. What should I do if I miss a pill?If you miss a pill and: It has been less than 12 hours since taking your last pill – take it straight away, and keep taking your pills as usual (even if you take 2 in one day). Your contraceptive protection should not be reduced.It has been more than 12 hours since taking your last pill – your contraceptive protection might be reduced, be sure to: take the pill you just recently missed as soon as you remember, even if you take 2 at oncecontinue to take a pill each day for the next 7 days at your usual time if you come to the end of a strip of pills during these 7 days, start the next strip without taking a 7-day break (you likely won’t bleed after you finish this second strip, this is normal)if you do not bleed after your second strip do a pregnancy test before starting the next one use extra contraception for 7 days after missing a pill (like condoms) If you missed 1 or more pills from the first week of your strip (days 1 to 7) and have had sex during that week, you might be pregnant. You should contact your doctor, pharmacist or family planning nurse as soon as possible. They may advise that you take emergency contraception. Find more detailed information on missed pills in your Femodette patient information leaflet. This information includes details on what to do if you have: lost or missed a pillbeen sick or have diarrhoea",

At ZAVA, we offer over 30 treatments, including but not limited to: Microgynon 30 – combined contraceptive pill that can also alleviate heavy menstrual bleeding and period painCerelle – progestogen-only pill, suitable if you cannot take oestrogenCerazette – progestogen-only pill, suitable if you are over the age of 35, smoke, or have high blood pressureYasmin – combined contraceptive, can alleviate acneLucette – combined contraceptive, can help with PMS symptoms Femodene – combined contraceptive, can help with painful periods and acneMercilon – low-dose combined contraceptive Browse and discover our range of contraceptives here at ZAVA.Femodene vs FemodetteThere is not much difference between Femodette and Femodene, except for the dosage amount.Femodette contains a lower dose of the synthetic oestrogen, ethinylestradiol (20 mcg). Femodene contains 30mcg of ethinylestradiol. So, the Femodette pill may be more suitable for you if you require a lower dose of oestrogen. If you are currently taking Femodene but think Femodette might be more suited to you, speak with your doctor. Femodette vs Millinette Femodette and Millinette contain the same hormones (gestodene and ethinylestradiol) and are both available in 75mcg/20mcg tablets. But while Femodette contains only 20mcg of ethinylestradiol, Millinette also comes in a higher dose of 30mcg. They are also manufactured by different companies. Femodette is manufactured by Bayer PLC, and Millinette is manufactured by Gedeon Richter Ltd. There is currently no generic version of this contraceptive. Femodette vs Yasmin Both Femodette and Yasmin are combined contraceptive pills, meaning that they contain synthetic versions of progesterone and oestrogen. They are both manufactured by Bayer PLC.Yasmin contains more oestrogen than Femodette – 30mcg of ethinylestradiol in Yasmin vs 20mcg. They also contain different types of synthetic progesterone (gestodene in Femodette vs drospirenone in Yasmin). Femodette vs Loestrin 20 and Loestrin 30 Femodette and Loestrin are both combined contraceptives. Femodette contains the same amount (20 mcg) of synthetic oestrogen (ethinylestradiol) as Loestrin 20. In 2019, Galen Pharma gave an update on Loestrin’s discontinuation due to problems with supplies. If you previously had taken Loestrin due to its low oestrogen dosage, Femodette might be a suitable alternative for you.

    "question": "How does Ovranette work?",
    "answer": "Ovranette contains 2 synthetic versions of the hormones oestrogen (ethinylestradiol) and progesterone (levonorgestrel), which work together to prevent pregnancy by: stopping ovulation – the release of an egg thickening cervical mucus – prevents sperm from reaching the egg thinning the uterine lining – reducing chances of implantation of an egg Due to the way the synthetic hormones work in Ovranette, it can also be used to help with hormone-related conditions or provide relief from period symptoms. Specifically, Ovranette has been clinically reported to also treat and ease pain associated with endometriosis, a condition where the lining of the uterus grows outside of itself. The pill can reduce oestrogen levels and slow the growth of this tissue. Ovranette can also be used to manage symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). For example, it can provide relief for heavy, painful, or irregular periods by: regulating periodsmaking periods lighter easing period pain If you have acne, Ovranette can help treat it because it reduces the levels of hormones which cause it. It can take a few months before you see changes or the full effect, as your body will be adjusting to the hormone changes when you first start taking it, so there may be more side effects during this time. How long does Ovranette last?If you stop taking Ovranette, it takes a few days for it to leave your body. Note that it can take a few months for your period to go back to how it was before you started taking it, as your hormones take time to regulate back to normal. You are at risk of pregnancy as soon as you stop taking the pill, so it’s important to keep taking it or use alternative contraception if you do stop taking it if you do not want to get pregnant.How long does Ovranette take to work?You can be immediately protected from pregnancy if you start to take Ovranette on the first day of your period. You will not need to use an additional form of contraception to prevent pregnancy, though the pill cannot prevent STIs, so you may still want to use a condom. If you start Ovranette after the first day of your period, you will need to use other contraception like condoms for the first 7 days of the first pack you are taking.How effective is Ovranette?Ovranette is over 99% effective when taken exactly as instructed and prescribed by your doctor. In typical use, it’s around 91% effective. This is because of things like people missing pills or pills not working due to vomiting (being sick) or diarrhoea. Being sick or having diarrhoea can prevent the pill from being absorbed, especially if it lasts more than a few hours. This is the same as missing a pill.",

    "question": "How to take Ovranette",
    "answer": "You should take 1 Ovranette pill at the same time every day, and swallow it whole with water. Your Ovranette pills will come in a packet strip with arrows on. You should follow the arrows on the strip, taking a pill every day until you finish all of your pills.Preferably, when first taking Ovranette, start it on the first day of your menstrual cycle (day 1 of your period) to be immediately protected. You can start it at any other time, but you’ll need to use an additional form of contraception to prevent pregnancy for 7 days, as this is how long it’ll take Ovranette to start working. There are several different ways to take Ovranette. Which way you take it will depend on personal preference, as well as whether you’re taking it to help with period-related symptoms:1. Taking the pill with a 7-day break (traditional method)Take Ovranette every day at the same time for 21 days (the whole pill packet). You will then have a 7-day pill break, during this time you take no pills, and may experience a withdrawal bleed, which is like a period. This is not an actual period and is actually caused by the break from the hormones in the pill.2. Tricycling the pillTricycling is a different method of pill taking where you take 3 pill packets in a row (making sure to take your pill at the same time every day) before having a 4-day break from pills. After the 4-day break, you’ll continue this cycle again. This means you’ll take fewer breaks and therefore have fewer ‘periods’ (withdrawal bleeds). 3. Continuous pill takingTake Ovranette every day at the same time, just as you would with the other methods. However, when you finish a pill packet, you should start the next one the next day, without taking breaks. This means you’ll always skip the withdrawal bleed. You can take the pill like this long-term, and it’s been proven to be effective at improving period-related medical conditions. If you want to try a different method of pill taking, make sure to discuss it with your doctor first. All of these methods are safe and effective. When to take Ovranette You can take Ovranette at any time, but you should take it at the same time each day. For example, if you start taking your first Ovranette pill at 5pm on a Friday, you should take it at 5pm on Saturday, and so on. You should take Ovranette at a time that you know you will be available to take it every day. For example, you may set out to take it in the morning before you brush your teeth, or in the evening after dinner. We recommend setting an alarm or using a reminder app to help you remember when to take your pill.",

You should contact your doctor or dial 111 if you think you may have taken too many Ovranette pills.

If you continue to vomit or have diarrhoea after this time, you should use additional contraception like a condom until you are better, and for 7 days after.",

    "question": "How to take Mercilon pills",
    "answer": "Taking Mercilon with a 7-day break:Take 1 Mercilon pill at around the same time each day for 21 days. On the back of the blister strip, you’ll see the days of the week printed on the foil. Start taking Mercilon on the day of the week it is and follow the arrows around until you complete all 21 pills. The arrows will help you to remember if you forget to take a pill.After finishing a strip of pills, you’ll have a 7-day pill-free break. You should start your next strip of pills on the eighth day. You may have some light bleeding during your break but you should still start the next cycle of pills on time, even if you have not finished bleeding.You’ll still have protection during this 7-day break, but only if you remember to start your next pack on time. You do not need to use extra contraception during this week. You can set a reminder to take your pill on your phone or keep your packet of pills somewhere easy for you to access.Taking Mercilon on a continuous regime:Combined contraceptive pills like Mercilon can also be taken on a continuous regime, especially when taken to improve irregular, heavy, or painful periods. This involves taking Mercilon every day, without taking a break. You’ll still need to take 1 Mercilon pill each day at the same time, but instead of taking a break between packs, you’ll go straight to your next pack of tablets. You’ll be protected from pregnancy the whole time, although effectiveness can decrease with missed and late doses. Make sure you order a repeat prescription in plenty of time, so you don’t run out of pills. Some women still get breakthrough bleeding (small bleeds like a period) but this may stop when you take Mercilon continuously. Taking Mercilon on an extended regime:Mercilon can also be taken on an extended regime to help with periods, or if you’d prefer to have fewer withdrawal bleeds. It’s taken the same as if you’re on a continuous regime (each day at the same time) but after 2 or 3 pill packets, you’ll then take a short break for 4-7 days. Discuss this with your doctor first so you can create an extended regime that works best for you. During your pill-free break, you’ll still be protected from pregnancy but only if you restart treatment within 7 days.",

My doctor recommended going on the mini pill which was even worse. I eventually got put on Mercilon as it's low estrogen. My periods are lighter and shorter, my skin has cleared up and my mood has been fine. Only negative side effect is loss of sex drive.” Anonymous, thelowdown.com“I used this for quite a while and to be honest it seemed like it was alright. Did get a loss of libido and the occasional headache but other than that I felt it was fine. Although I have been trying different contraception and have recently gone back onto Mercellion. Turns out it’s not as good as I thought. My moods are not good. I have a short temper on these and my anxiety is through the roof. It’s only when you come off something and come back a year later that actually you can tell a difference.” Kirstie89, thelowdown.com“I've had very minimal problems using this pill other than loss of sex drive (kind of what I started taking it for lol). Honestly though, it's been really easy sailing with this pill, lighter periods, helped my acne, no crazy side effects. It has a low dose of oestrogen so I think that helps. I will be switching back to this one once I'm finished with my new one.” Anonymous, thelowdown.com “I took this pill for two months, however, due to the bad skin eruption I had as a side effect, I decided to change it. My acne worsened within a week of starting taking this pill. I did not experience any other issue, other than some spotting in between periods and a couple of episodes of migraine during the pill break. Having PCOS and already acne-prone skin, I have been advised to swap from a pill containing Desogestrel to one with drospirenone.” Anonymous, thelowdown.com",

This is due to the active ingredients which can regulate androgen levels and reduce the amount of sebum you produce.Sebum is a natural oily substance that can protect and hydrate your skin. In people with acne, too much sebum is produced, causing hair follicles in the skin to become blocked, forming spots.It may take 6 to 12 weeks to see an improvement in your acne if you take Microgynon. It takes time for your body to adjust to the hormones in the pill, and during this time, your acne could be worse.

You should also have a yearly pill check-up, where a doctor will check if the pill is still safe for you to take. If you are worried about the risk of blood clots, you can use the mini pill instead.

It is over 99% effective when taken correctly.Millinette contains ethinylestradiol (oestrogen) and gestodene (progesterone) that work to prevent pregnancy by stopping ovulation, thickening the cervical mucus, and thinning the womb lining. It is available in a lower dose for women who are at an increased risk of oestrogen side effects.

  {
    "question": "What is Millinette?",
    "answer": "Millinette is a combined oral contraceptive pill that contains man-made versions of the hormones oestrogen (ethinylestradiol) and progesterone (gestodene). These hormones work together to regulate your menstrual cycle to stop you getting pregnant.Millinette is available in 2 dosage strengths:20/7530/75Both pills contain the same amount of gestodene, 75 micrograms (mcg), but different amounts of oestrogen. The pill with the lowest dose contains 20mcg of oestrogen to reduce the risk of side effects and is known as a ‘low-dose pill’. Can Millinette help with acne?Yes, some people take Millinette to improve the appearance of acne. For Millinette in particular, research has shown that 75mcg of gestodene combined with 30mcg of ethinylestradiol improved acne in most patients, with 62% reporting none or minimal acne lesions. This means if you want to take Millinette for acne, a higher dose of oestrogen is recommended, as oestrogen is the ingredient in the pill that helps with acne symptoms and oil production. “Here at ZAVA, we can’t prescribe the pill specifically for acne, but we can recommend which pill would be best if you have acne and also want to prevent pregnancy. Combined pills like Millinette are recommended for acne over the progesterone-only pill, which can sometimes make acne worse. If you have acne and over-the-counter treatments aren’t helping, we also prescribe a range of acne treatments.” Dr Babak Ashrafi, Clinical Lead for Service Expansion",

    "question": "How does Millinette work?",
    "answer": "The Millinette pill, containing ethinylestradiol and gestodene, works in 3 ways to prevent pregnancy:Stops the ovaries from releasing an egg each month (ovulation).Thickens the cervical mucus to stop sperm reaching an egg.Thins the womb lining, making it difficult for an egg to implant itself.How long does Millinette take to work?If you start taking Millinette on days 1 to 5 of your period, you will be protected from pregnancy straight away. If you start it after day 5, you’ll need to use condoms for 7 days before you will have full protection. If you are taking Millinette to also improve acne, it can take several weeks or months before your skin gets better. Your body will take time to adjust to the medication, and at first, it may seem like your skin is not improving or even getting worse – this is normal but you should see some improvement by 3 months. In some cases, it can take up to a year to see the full effects. How effective is Millinette?When taken exactly as prescribed, Millinette is more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy, although it’s likely to be closer to 91% effective when you factor in things like missing a pill or sickness (vomiting and diarrhoea can reduce the effectiveness of the pill if it happens within 4 hours of taking it).",

  {
    "question": "How to take Millinette",
    "answer": "Millinette pills are supplied in strips of 21 tablets, each marked with the corresponding day of the week they should be taken. When taking Millinette, you should:Select the pill that relates to the correct day of the week – if it is Monday, choose the first pill that says ‘Mon’.Swallow 1 pill at the same time every day, for 21 days, with water if necessary.Follow the direction of the arrows on the strip for 21 days until you have taken all of the pills. When you have finished the strip, have a 7–day break where you take no pills for 7 days.You should experience a withdrawal bleed, like a period, during this break and you’ll still be protected against pregnancy so no need for extra protection.On the 8th day, begin a new strip, even if you are still bleeding.These instructions are the same if you take the lower or standard Millinette dose. If you take Millinette in this way, you should start a new strip on the same day each week and have a withdrawal bleed every 4th week.There are other ways to take your combined pill if you don’t want breaks as often, or at all. You should discuss this with your doctor before changing how you take your pill, but you can also try:Tricycling – take 3 packets of Millinette back-to-back before having a 4-day break. You will likely have a withdrawal bleed, but this should be lighter and shorter than a period. On the 5th day, even if you’re bleeding, start this process again. This means you’ll only bleed every 3 months. Evidence suggests that this method can make the pill more reliable.Continuous – take Millinette without a break, starting a new pack as soon as you’ve finished your last one. You won’t have a pill-free break so won’t have a withdrawal bleed, but you may get some breakthrough bleeding. If you get spotting or bleeding for 3 days in a row, take a 4-day break and then continue taking your pill continuously. You shouldn’t do this more than once a month. If you get persistent spotting or bleeding, your doctor may recommend another method of pill-taking. If you’re unsure, you can find a full list of instructions in the Millinette patient information leaflet or by speaking with your doctor or pharmacist. When to take MillinetteYou can take Millinette at any time during the day that suits you, as long as you take it at the same time each day. You might find it easier to take it at the same time as something else you do every day, such as brushing your teeth or going to bed. If you think you might forget to take your pill, set an alarm on your phone to remind you. When you first start Millinette, you should start it on days 1 to 5 of your period if you can, so you are protected against pregnancy straight away. However, you can start Millinette at any time during your menstrual cycle. If you take it after day 5, you’ll need to use another method of contraception, like condoms, for 7 days. How much Millinette to takeYou only need to take 1 Millinette pill each day regardless of which method you follow for taking your pill. You won’t take any pills on your pill-free days if you have them. Your doctor will discuss whether the low or standard dose is most suitable for you. The low-dose Millinette pill contains 20mcg of oestrogen compared to 30mcg in the standard dose. The low-dose pill is recommended for people who may be at a higher risk of experiencing side effects when taking the pill. How long do you need to take Millinette for?Each Millinette strip is taken for 21 days until you have taken all of the pills. Then, you will have a 7-day break where you do not take any pills, but will likely experience a withdrawal bleed. Follow the instructions from your doctor if you take the pill in a different way. How long is it safe to take Millinette for?Millinette can be taken for as long as you do not want to become pregnant. It is safe to take long-term and you’ll need to have yearly pill checks with your doctor so they can check it's still a safe and suitable option for you, but you should report any continuous or serious side effects straight away. If you want to have a baby, you can stop taking Millinette at any time, but you will no longer be protected against pregnancy from the day you stop taking the pill.What should I do if I miss the pill?If you are less than 12 hours lateTake the last missed pill as soon as you remember, even if that means taking 2 pills in the same day. Then, continue taking your next pills as usual. Your protection against pregnancy shouldn’t be reduced.If you are more than 12 hours lateTake the missed pill as soon as you remember, even if it means taking 2 pills in 1 day. Then, continue taking the rest of your pills as normal, but you will need to use an additional non-hormonal method of medication, such as condoms for the next 7 days.",

Millinette contains gestodene while Rigevidon contains levonorgestrel.Millinette vs FemodetteThe low dose version of Millinette and Femodette contain the same active ingredients in the same dosages, 75mcg gestodene and 20mcg ethinylestradiol. They work in exactly the same way but have different brand names. Millinette vs LoestrinMillinette and Loestrin are both birth control pills available in a low and standard dose. However, Loestrin is no longer available. Is Millinette the same as Yasmin?No, Millinette and Yasmin are not the same. They are both combined pills but they contain different active ingredients. Millinette contains ethinylestradiol and gestodene whereas Yasmin contains ethinylestradiol and drospirenone. Drospirenone is a 4th generation progesterone whereas gestodene is 3rd generation. This means drospirenone is a newer type of progesterone and is less likely to cause breakthrough bleeding and androgenic side effects like acne.",

    "question": "How to take Hana",
    "answer": "Take 1 Hana pill every day at the same time, and do not take a break in between packs. Each Hana pack contains 28 pills with the days of the week printed on the pack and arrows showing the order in which to take the tablets. It’s recommended to take Hana as follows:Every time you start a new pack, take a pill that is labelled with the correct day of the week. So, if you are taking the first tablet in the pack on a Monday, take a pill labelled ‘Mon’. You should not start with just any pill as this may increase the chances of forgetting to take the Hana pill or cause confusion. Take 1 pill a day until the pack is empty. You should swallow the pill whole, and you can take it with some water if you need to. Start a new pack of Hana the next day. You do not have a break between packs when taking Hana or need to wait for a bleed.Taking Hana at the same time you do something else, like brushing your teeth, can make it easier to remember every day. We also recommend taking it at a time you know you will be able to every day, or setting an alarm or using a pill reminder app if you find it difficult to remember when to take it. ➤ Hana can prevent pregnancy but not sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). If you do not use another form of contraception, you could be at risk of catching an STI, so it’s important to get regularly tested. You can do this with an at-home STI test kit, or at your local sexual health clinic. What if I miss a dose of Hana?Missing a Hana pill can reduce its effectiveness. Here’s what to do if you miss a dose of Hana:Within 12 hoursIf you realise you have missed your Hana pill within the 12-hour window (within 12 hours from the time you usually take it), take the delayed pill straight away. Then take your next pill as usual, even if this means taking 2 pills in a day. Your protection will still be effective. Over 12 hoursIf you are over 12 hours late, leave any missed pills and immediately take the most recently missed one, then continue taking Hana as normal. Use additional contraception for 7 days, such as condoms.Within the first week of taking HanaIf you miss 1 or more pills in the very first week of taking Hana and have had sex the week before, the risk of getting pregnant is higher than at any other time in your cycle. Speak to a doctor or pharmacist for advice straight away, as you may need to use emergency contraception (the morning after pill).➤ Find more detailed information on what to do if you forget to take the pill. What if I take too much Hana?There should be no serious harmful effects from taking too much Hana. You may get some side effects like feeling or being sick, or a slight change in vaginal bleeding. If you’re concerned after taking more Hana pills than prescribed, speak to your doctor or pharmacist. What if I throw up after taking Hana?If you vomit within 3 to 4 hours of taking Hana, it counts as missing a pill. In this case, you should take another Hana pill. If you’re not sick again, you can resume taking Hana as normal.If you’re ill with frequent vomiting and/or have diarrhoea, continue to take your pill as normal, but use additional protection if you have sex throughout your illness and for 7 days after.",

If you are allergic or intolerant to lactose, speak to a doctor before taking Hana.The contraceptive pill and breast cancerThe risk of breast cancer is slightly higher in people taking the contraceptive pill and increases with age. More research is needed into progesterone-only pills like Hana, though it’s thought that the risk is similar or lower to that of the combined pill. For example, out of 10,000 people taking the contraceptive pill for up to 5 years:approximately 1 extra case is reported when it’s stopped before age 20approximately 20 extra cases are reported when it’s stopped before age 40The contraceptive pill and blood clotsThe risk of a blood clot is higher in people on contraceptive pills, but no higher than the risk in pregnant women. Mini pills like Hana are thought to be lower risk compared to combined pills, however, more research is needed. Before you take Hana, a healthcare professional will make sure that your risk of blood clots is low. It is important to inform your doctor of your medical history, and any history of blood clots in your family. If you’re due to have surgery or be immobile for any length of time, speak to your doctor, as you may need to stop taking Hana during this time.Hana and other medications Other medications and herbal remedies can interfere with Hana and stop it from working properly.

Taking emergency contraceptionIf you use a morning after pill containing ulipristal acetate (ellaOne) during your cycle, you must stop taking Hana and wait 5 days before taking it again. You must also use additional barrier contraception if you have sex during these 5 days, as well as for the first 7 days of taking Hana (for a total of 12 days).Taking Hana and ulipristal acetate together can alter the effect of both these medications, resulting in reduced contraceptive effect and increased risk of pregnancy. Hana during pregnancy and breastfeedingDo not use Hana if you’re pregnant, or think you might be. Take a pregnancy test if your period is late and you’ve missed any pills in the last month, or if you have any other signs of pregnancy. If you become pregnant, stop taking Hana straight away.

    "question": "How to take Zelleta",
    "answer": "To effectively protect yourself from pregnancy, Zelleta needs to be taken once every day around the same time. Swallow each pill with a bit of water. Do not chew, split, or crush your pill.Zelleta strips are labelled to help you to remember to take it every day, and each day of the week is labelled alongside a pill. Taking your pills while following the day of the week you’re on can make it easier to keep track. Once you have finished a strip of 28 pills, you should immediately start a new one on the next day. There is no pill-free break between strips, which means you must take Zelleta continuously. If you have trouble remembering to take your pill, we recommend setting a reminder or alarm for your pill every day, because not taking it properly will reduce its effectiveness. You may prefer to try taking Zelleta at the same time you do something else out of habit, like brushing your teeth, to help you remember. While taking the pill, you should have regular check-ups with your doctor where they will check your health, any side effects, and your blood pressure. This is to make sure the pill you’re taking is still the safest and best option for you. Pill checks are usually once a year, but may be more often if you have certain health conditions. What if I miss a dose of Zelleta?If you notice that you have missed your pill, you need to check how much time has passed since you were originally supposed to take it.If it has been less than 12 hours: Take the pill as soon as you remember and then continue with your regular schedule – even if this means taking 2 pills in 1 day. There’s no need for additional protection.If it has been more than 12 hours: Take the missed pill as soon as you remember – and then use additional protection (like condoms) for the next 7 days. The more pills you forget, the higher the chance of pregnancy becomes. Within the first week of taking Zelleta: Missing 1 or more pills during this time, especially if you had sex the week before starting it, could mean that you get pregnant. Speak to your doctor about emergency contraception if this is the case for you. What if I take too much Zelleta?If you have accidentally taken more pills than you should have, side effects like nausea or vomiting can occur, or can be a little stronger than usual. Serious side effects from taking too much Zelleta are unlikely. If you think you have taken too much Zelleta, tell your doctor. What if I throw up after taking Zelleta?If you throw up or have severe diarrhoea within 4 hours of taking your Zelleta pill, it may not have been fully absorbed, and you’ll need to take another pill straight away. Take your next pill at your usual time. If you do not take another pill within 12 hours of your normal time, use additional contraception to prevent pregnancy for 2 days.If you continue to have vomiting and/or severe diarrhoea, keep using another form of contraception until you’re better, and for 2 days after.",

NHS guidelines state pills containing 75mcg of desogestrel be offered first, however, as Zelleta is branded, it’s more likely they’ll offer you a generic version. The generic version of Zelleta works in the same way but may have different inactive ingredients.",

    "question": "Zelleta side effects",
    "answer": "Zelleta can cause side effects, although not everybody will get them. A common side effect of Zelleta is vaginal bleeding, which may happen at irregular intervals and is most likely within the first few months of taking it, or if you miss pills. This can be anything from very light to heavier bleeding, which feels like a period. You may also not have any bleeding at all. This is not a sign that Zelleta is not working, and you should continue to take it as prescribed. If bleeding is heavy or prolonged, speak to your doctor. Common side effects (affecting more than or equal to than 1 in 100 people) include: mood changes depressed mooddecreased sex drive (libido)headachefeeling sick (nausea) acne breast pain irregular or no periods weight increase Uncommon side effects (affecting less than 1 in 100 people) include:infection of the vaginadifficulties in wearing contact lensesbeing sick (vomiting) hair losspainful periods ovarian cyststirednessRare side effects (affecting less than 1 in 1000 people) include:skin conditions such as rash, hives, or painful blue-red skin lumps (erythema nodosum)Serious side effects include a severe allergic reaction. You or someone else should call 999 straight away if you have symptoms such as:a swollen face, tongue, or throatdifficulties swallowinghives difficulties breathing reduced consciousnessIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in the patient information leaflet.Zelleta and breast cancerThe risk of breast cancer is slightly higher when taking the contraceptive pill and this risk increases with age. More research is needed into progesterone-only pills like Zelleta, though it’s thought that the risk is similar or lower than oestrogen pills (the combined pill). Research shows that out of 10,000 people taking the contraceptive pill for up to 5 years:around 1 extra case is reported when the pill is stopped before age 20around 20 extra cases are reported when the pill is stopped before age 40Zelleta and blood clotsThe risk of a blood clot is higher in people taking the contraceptive pill but no higher than the risk in pregnant women. Mini pills like Zelleta are thought to be lower risk compared to oestrogen-containing pills but more research is needed. Before you take Zelleta, a healthcare professional needs to make sure that your risk of blood clots is low. It’s important to tell your doctor of your medical history, and any history of blood clots in your family. If you’re due to have surgery or will be immobile for any reason, speak to your doctor. You will need to stop taking Zelleta during this time as your risk of blood clots will be higher. How long do Zelleta side effects last?The side effects of Zelleta typically last between a few weeks to a few months, although they may last longer. This is because it takes time for your body to get used to the change in hormones. Taking it properly at the same time each day, without missing pills, can help your body get used to it.What to do if you get Zelleta side effectsMild side effects are common and should subside. We suggest waiting for your body to adjust, and in the meantime for:nausea or vomiting – take your pill at night and not on an empty stomachspotting or irregular periods – take your pill at the same time each day and use pantyliners until it becomes more regular or stopsheadaches – take over-the-counter painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofenbreast tenderness – wear a supportive bra, apply a warm compress, and take painkillersacne – practice good skin care and speak to your doctor if this is severe or long-lastingincreased body weight – eat a healthy, balanced diet and get plenty of exercise each week (around 150 minutes per week)vaginal infection – speak to your doctor or pharmacist to get the correct treatmentSome people taking Zelleta have reported feeling depressed. Depression can be serious and may sometimes lead to suicidal thoughts. If you get symptoms of depression and you are struggling to manage, speak to your doctor or a mental health support line as soon as possible.",

    "question": "What is the morning after pill?",
    "answer": "The morning after pill is a type of emergency contraception. You can use emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy if you’ve had unprotected sex or if your normal contraception has failed. The morning after pill works by preventing ovulation and the fertilisation of an egg. There are 3 types of morning after pill in the UK that you can get.1. ellaOne: The most effective morning after pill, which works up to 5 days (120 hours) after unprotected sex.2. Levonelle: A branded version of levonorgestrel, which works up to 3 days (72 hours) after unprotected sex.3. Generic levonorgestrel: A low-cost morning after pill which works up to 3 days (72 hours) after unprotected sex. It is the generic form of Levonelle which means it contains the same ingredient and therefore works the same way, it just has a different price and packaging.“Millions of women have used the morning after pill to avoid unwanted pregnancies. They are very effective and can give you peace of mind. But, as the name suggests, you do need to take them as soon as possible after having unprotected sex, so acting fast is crucial. Whether you choose to order one online or get it from your local pharmacy or GP, the sooner you take the pill, the better.” – Dr Brenda Ikeji, Medical Editor.",

    "question": "How does the morning after pill work?",
    "answer": "All morning after pills work in the same way. They can prevent pregnancy by:stopping or delaying ovulation, which is when your body releases an egg to be fertilisedthickening the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to enter your womb (uterus)thinning the lining of the uterus, so a pregnancy cannot develop if an egg does get fertilisedThese 3 actions make it very unlikely that you’ll get pregnant. The morning after pill simply delays an egg from being released. It’s not a form of abortion, and it does not affect your fertility in any way. Levonelle and generic levonorgestrel can be taken up to 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex. However, it is most effective within the first 24 hours, and gets less effective by day 3.ellaOne can be taken up to 120 hours (5 days) after you have sex, and is 98% effective on all 5 days.The morning after pill will only prevent pregnancy after you have unprotected sex. If you take it and then have unprotected sex again, you will be at risk of pregnancy.When will the morning after pill not work?If you have already ovulated, the morning after pill will not work. Ovulation usually happens in the middle of your menstrual cycle or around 10 to 16 days after your period. If you track your periods and know you ovulated at the time you had unprotected sex, then a sperm and an egg may have already met, meaning a morning after pill would not have any effect.If this has happened, the best emergency contraception to use is the copper coil. Your GP or local sexual health clinic can insert it up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sex to prevent a pregnancy, even if you have ovulated.If you are already pregnant and take the morning after pill, it will not stop that pregnancy. It does not impact the developing foetus if you take it without realising that you are pregnant. Speak to your doctor if you find out you’re pregnant after taking the morning after pill – they can give you further information and support on other options. Emergency contraception does not protect you from catching an STI. Taking regular STI tests if you have unprotected sex can help keep you and your sexual partners safe.",

    "answer": "All morning after pills are effective when taken correctly and within the appropriate time frame. However, studies show that ellaOne is slightly more effective (it’s about 98% effective, compared to 95% for Levonelle). ellaOne can also be taken up to 5 days after sex, whereas Levonelle is only effective for 3 days. The morning after pill’s effectiveness is slightly different depending on the ingredient, and your doctor will recommend which is best for preventing pregnancy depending on when you had sex.",

If you are concerned about this occurring when taking the morning after pill, you can ask your doctor, pharmacist, or sexual health clinic for more information on the intrauterine device (IUD). The IUD is an effective form of emergency contraception that is not affected by vomiting or diarrhoea.How often can you take the morning after pill?You can take the morning after pill more than once in your menstrual cycle, but this can cause irregular periods and may increase the chance of getting side effects,so it’s not recommended.Using a regular form of contraception, such as the contraceptive pill (‘the pill’) or a copper IUD (‘the coil’) is a more reliable method of preventing pregnancy.➤ For more guidance on contraceptive methods check out our guide.",

    "question": "Morning after pill FAQs",
    "answer": "Which morning after pill is the best?ellaOne is often considered the ‘best’ morning after pill as it is the most effective pill in preventing pregnancy. It’s 98% effective in preventing pregnancy throughout the 120 hours you can take it. Levonelle and generic levonorgestrel are 95% effective if you take them within 24 hours, 85% effective when taken within 25 to 48 hours, and 58% effective when taken between 49 to 72 hours.However, as they contain different medicines, you may get different side effects from each medication. So what is best for one person might not be suitable for you.What if I throw up after taking the morning after pill?If you throw up within 3 hours of taking either ellaOne or Levonelle, you should take another tablet as soon as possible. The medication will not have been absorbed and will not be effective in preventing pregnancy.Can I get pregnant after taking the morning after pill?There is a very small chance that you can still get pregnant after taking the morning after pill. It will not work if you’ve already ovulated or are already pregnant. No contraceptive method is 100% effective, which means there’s always a risk of pregnancy after sex.The morning after pill does not have any long term effects on fertility. You’ll be able to try for a baby immediately after you take the pill but it may interfere with your next period and ovulation.If you have unprotected sex after taking the morning after pill, you must use emergency contraception again if you want to prevent pregnancy.Can I take my usual contraceptive pill at the same time?You may have to wait to take your regular contraceptive pill after using the morning after pill, and you may need to use additional contraception. It depends what type of morning after pill you’ve taken, and the contraceptive pill you’re on.Always ask a healthcare professional for advice and read the patient information leaflet in your pack of pills as the morning after pill can affect the effectiveness of other contraceptive methods. For example, if you take ellaOne, you must use condoms as well as take your regular contraceptive pill until you get your period. ellaOne can make normal contraceptive pills temporarily less effective.How can you tell if the morning after pill worked?You can only tell if the morning after pill worked when you get your next period. You should take a pregnancy test if your next period is more than 7 days late or you get pregnancy symptoms like nausea or irregular bleeding that last for longer than a few days after you took the pill.Can I take the morning after pill while breastfeeding?You can take the morning after pill while breastfeeding but you will have to wait after taking it before you can breastfeed again. This is because the active ingredient can be secreted into your breast milk.For Levonelle and generic levonorgestrel, you should take the pill straight after feeding and have already expressed extra milk if possible. Then, avoid breastfeeding for at least 8 hours or bottle feed.For ellaOne, there is not enough data on how the active ingredient can affect babies when breastfeeding. Because of this, it’s recommended to avoid breastfeeding for 1 week after taking it. During this week, express and discard your breast milk. You’ll need to express beforehand and bottle feed. If this doesn’t work for you, Levonelle or the copper coil may be a better option.How soon after taking the morning after pill can I have sex?You can have sex whenever you want after taking the morning after pill but if you have unprotected sex again, it won’t work to prevent that pregnancy. You’d need to take another morning after pill or make sure you use another form of contraception like condoms.Can a man buy the morning after pill in the UK?A man can buy the morning after pill in the UK on a woman’s behalf, but it’s up to the pharmacist or doctor whether they will allow it. Whether you get it from a clinic, pharmacy, or online, the healthcare professional providing the morning after pill needs to know who is taking the medication to make sure it’s safe and suitable. They also need your consent that you’re happy to take the pill and understand the pros and cons.If you get the morning after pill with ZAVA, you only need to answer a few online questions about your health, without talking to anyone face-to-face. Men cannot buy the morning after pill from ZAVA.Does the morning after pill cause weight gain?No, there is no evidence the morning after pill causes weight. As it’s only 1 dose, it’s not likely to cause any long-term effects.Can you drink alcohol after taking the morning after pill?Yes, you can drink alcohol after taking either morning after pill. It won’t reduce its effectiveness, but be careful drinking too much after taking it. Vomiting within 3 hours means you’d need to take another dose. If you get any side effects after taking the morning after pill, we recommend avoiding alcohol or it may make you feel worse.How soon should you take a morning after pill?You should take your morning after pill as soon as you can after having unprotected sex. If you take Levonelle, it is most effective in the first 24 hours, then gets less effective in days 2 and 3 after having sex. It stops being effective 3 days after unprotected sex.If you take ellaOne, you can take it any time in the first 5 days after having unprotected sex, and it’s just as effective. But it’s still better to take it as soon as possible. If you wait longer, then there’s a chance an egg could be released and meet a sperm, which would make a morning after pill taken later, ineffective.",

    "question": "What is cystitis?",
    "answer": "Cystitis is an inflammation of the bladder usually caused by an infection in your lower urinary tract. It’s not always caused by bacteria but this is the most common cause.Cystitis affects women more often than men – 13 to 14% of males will experience it in their lives, while around 50% of women do. Women are more susceptible to bacterial cystitis because bacteria can travel more easily through the shorter urethra that women have. Antibiotics are not always needed to treat cystitis – your body might clear the infection on its own with the self-treatment of cystitis. If the symptoms of cystitis have not improved within 3 days, speak to your doctor to get antibiotic treatment for the infection. You may also be able to order treatment for cystitis online. With ZAVA, you need to answer a questionnaire that will be reviewed by our doctors. If they believe you have cystitis, we can send you antibiotics for cystitis treatment. It’s also important to be aware of interstitial cystitis (IC), which is long-term inflammation of the bladder (it can have similar symptoms to cystitis, but different causes). You can find out more in our guide to interstitial cystitis. “Cystitis can be very uncomfortable and cause real pain and distress. The good news is that it can often be treated very effectively using antibiotics, and most patients make a full recovery quickly. However, it’s important to get treatment as soon as possible to prevent the condition getting worse.” – Dr Zoe Miller, Medical Editor.",

    "question": "What causes cystitis?",
    "answer": "Bacterial cystitis is commonly caused by certain bacteria from your poo, such as E. coli, getting into your urethra. This typically occurs if you wipe back to front when going to the toilet.Other things that may increase the risk of bacteria entering your bladder include:having a bacterial infectionside effects from medications, such as those used to treat cancerchemicals in hygiene products that irritate your genitalspregnancydiabeteshaving a weakened immune systemhaving been through menopauseusing spermicide with contraceptionhaving a catheterKnowing what triggers cystitis for you is important, so you can manage the condition as best as you can.",

    "question": "What are the symptoms of cystitis?",
    "answer": "Common symptoms of cystitis in adult men and women include:needing to pee more frequently, including at nightneeding to pee very urgently which can lead to incontinence (loss of bladder control)a burning or stinging sensation when you peedark-coloured, cloudy, or bad-smelling urineblood in the urinepain in your lower tummypain during sexual intercoursedifficulty urinatingIn women, the symptoms of cystitis can be confused with other vaginal infections. These include bacterial vaginosis (BV) and thrush. Both of these infections can change your vaginal discharge, whereas in cystitis you should not see any change.It’s important to identify if the infection is a UTI. Treating the wrong infections with antibiotics can give you problems when taking antibiotics in the future. If you cannot wait for a doctor’s appointment, you can request a UTI test strip through ZAVA. Our UTI test strip will quickly identify if you have a UTI, and you can do the test from the comfort of your own home. If the infection spreads to your kidneys, you’ll need stronger treatment. Symptoms of a kidney infection include:feeling sick or being sicksharp pain on one side of your backa tender abdomenblood in your urinea temperaturediarrhoeaflu-like symptomsThis is a more serious infection that requires immediate medical attention. If you’re experiencing any of the symptoms above, call 111 or make an urgent GP appointment. If you feel seriously unwell and are drowsy and/or confused, get someone to call 999.",

    "question": "How do you treat cystitis?",
    "answer": "Cystitis can be treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics are not available over the counter. You’ll need a prescription from a doctor to get cystitis treatment antibiotics. Your doctor will ask you to take a urine sample to do a UTI test to check if you have cystitis. You can also buy cystitis treatment or a UTI Test from the comfort of your home through a registered and regulated online doctor service like ZAVA.If this is your first cystitis infection or you do not get cystitis very often, you’ll be given a short course of antibiotics. This is usually for 3 days. The most widely used antibiotics for cystitis treatment are: nitrofurantoin 100mg, twice a day, for 3 daystrimethoprim 200mg twice a day, for 3 days (if you cannot take nitrofurantoin)If there is no improvement in your symptoms after at least 48 hours, or the antibiotics you were prescribed are causing unmanageable side effects, your doctor may prescribe:nitrofurantoin 100mg, twice a day for 3 days (if not used first)pivmecillinam as a 400mg initial dose, followed by 200mg 3 times a day for a total of 3 daysfosfomycin 3g single dose sachet (a powder mixed with a glass of water until dissolved and drank in 1 dose)Your doctor will review your general health and check if you have allergies before giving you antibiotics.You can request nitrofurantoin treatment for cystitis from ZAVA. Nitrofurantoin is a highly effective antibiotic for cystitis treatment, with studies showing it cures between 79% and 92% of patients. It works by killing the bacteria in your urinary tract. If you are given this treatment for a UTI, you’ll take 1 capsule twice a day for 3 days. You can take nitrofurantoin with or after food.Remember to space the doses out evenly, such as in the morning with breakfast and in the evening after dinner. Always finish the full course of antibiotics to make sure the infection is fully treated. If nitrofurantoin is not suitable for you, our doctors may recommend trimethoprim instead.",

    "question": "Side effects of cystitis treatment",
    "answer": "NitrofurantoinNitrofurantoin has very few side effects and is generally a well-tolerated medication. You may feel sick when taking the first few doses but this will usually disappear after a few hours. Other nitrofurantoin side effects may include: dizzinessloss of appetiteheadaches Remember to take nitrofurantoin with food to reduce the side effects it can have on your stomach. Sometimes nitrofurantoin might change the colour of your urine and it will look darker than usual. This is temporary and will stop once you finish the treatment course.You can find out more about common side effects on our nitrofurantoin product page. For a full list of side effects, please refer to the patient information leaflet included with the medication.TrimethoprimIf you take trimethoprim as a cystitis treatment, one of the most common side effects is thrush. This is because although antibiotics work by killing the bacteria causing an infection, they can also kill normal harmless bacteria which protect you against thrush. If you do get thrush symptoms while taking antibiotics for cystitis, you can get thrush treatment online or over the counter to get rid of the infection sooner.Pregnancy and breastfeedingFor cystitis treatment in pregnancy or when breastfeeding, speak to your doctor about UTI treatment. They may prescribe different kinds of antibiotics. Cystitis treatment at homeYou may be able to treat some symptoms of cystitis at home using self-care remedies. Whether or not you are taking antibiotics, our cystitis self-care tips include:1. Taking over-the-counter painkillers: if you are in pain from the infection, paracetamol and ibuprofen can help alleviate lingering symptoms as you recover. 2. Using heat pads or a hot water bottle: this can help to relieve back and abdominal pain associated with cystitis.3. Using cystitis relief sachets: you can purchase this remedy over-the-counter and simply add them to a glass of water. This does not cure cystitis but can help soothe pain by minimising the acidity of your urine. However, there is minimal evidence that these work once you already have a UTI.4. Stay hydrated: keeping hydrated will flush the infection out of the system. 5. Wear loose clothing: you should wear cotton underwear and loose pants as you recover from cystitis to stay comfortable and avoid further irritation. To help you recover faster from cystitis, we recommend avoiding: perfumed hygiene products, which can irritate your genital areaholding your urine too long – make sure you go to the toilet as soon as you need itfoods and drinks that are high in sugarcoffee and alcohol – these are both known as diuretics, which can irritate your bladder and make you need to pee more frequently having sex or masturbating, as this can cause irritation ➤ If you would like more information on UTIs and how to get rid of them, learn more in our guide.",

When taking nitrofurantoin, make sure that you:swallow the capsule wholetake the capsule with or after foodTo treat cystitis, the standard nitrofurantoin dosage is 100mg capsule twice a day, for:3 days for women7 days for men Nitrofurantoin is usually prescribed for 7 days if you are pregnant, though it is typically advised to avoid prescribing during the third trimester. While taking 100mg nitrofurantoin twice a day, be sure to space the doses evenly (around 10 to 12 hours apart).You should finish the whole course of antibiotics, even if you feel better.How effective is nitrofurantoin at clearing up cystitis?Nitrofurantoin is very effective in clearing up cystitis and you will feel better within a few days after you take it. Clinical studies have shown nitrofurantoin to help cure between 79% and 92% of people who take nitrofurantoin for a UTI. After you take nitrofurantoin, your body will pass it through your urinary tract. Many bacteria found in the urinary tract are sensitive to nitrofurantoin. This means nitrofurantoin is an ideal antibiotic to kill the bacteria which cause cystitis and clear it up.How long does nitrofurantoin take to work on cystitis?Nitrofurantoin should work on cystitis a few hours after you take your first capsule. You should feel an improvement in the burning sensation when you pee. You may need to pee less often too. However, to make sure you kill all the bacteria causing the cystitis, it’s important to finish your course of antibiotics. Otherwise, your cystitis can come back or reoccur (this is called recurrent cystitis).How long does it take nitrofurantoin to clear a UTI?It usually takes 3 days for nitrofurantoin to clear a UTI in female adult patients, and 7 days in male adult patients and pregnant women.",

    "answer": "Trimethoprim is an antibiotic – a type of medicine that kills bacteria. It’s a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which means that it can kill a range of different bacteria.The UTI antibiotic trimethoprim is used to treat cystitis. While cystitis means inflammation of the bladder and can be caused by many different things, the term is usually used as another way to describe a urinary tract infection that affects the bladder. Cystitis is caused by bacteria, and typically, it causes symptoms including:a stinging or burning feeling when you peefeeling like you need to pee more often and more urgentlydarker, cloudier, or stronger-smelling pee than usualpain in your lower tummyblood in your urineIf you have symptoms of cystitis and they do not improve with time or with UTI home remedies, you may need treatment with an antibiotic to clear the infection.Trimethoprim used to be the preferred treatment for cystitis. However, in recent years there has been an increase in antibiotic resistance to trimethoprim. Antibiotic resistance is when bacteria have evolved so they are not destroyed by medicines which used to be effective against them. To treat cystitis, nitrofurantoin is now usually recommended as the first-line treatment. However if you are unable to take it or it does not work for you, trimethoprim may be a suitable alternative. Your doctor will advise if trimethoprim is suitable for you.Trimethoprim is sometimes used to prevent cystitis from recurring (coming back). It’s also sometimes used to treat other conditions, including acne and chest infections.Trimethoprim has been used to treat UTIs for decades and is a highly effective antibiotic. While nitrofurantoin is now the first-line antibiotic for UTIs, doctors may still prescribe trimethoprim if you are allergic to nitrofurantoin, or if there’s another medical reason it’s not suitable for you.",

    "question": "How to take Trimethoprim",
    "answer": "You need to take trimethoprim tablets orally. It is easiest to take your trimethoprim dose with a glass of water.To treat cystitis, 1 trimethoprim tablet is normally taken twice a day, for 3 days. Men and pregnant women usually take a course of trimethoprim for 7 days. Also for pregnant women, this will depend on which trimester you are in so consult your doctor prior to taking trimethoprim. For more severe UTIs, the course can be longer (up to 14 days). You should take trimethoprim for as long as you have been prescribed it. Your doctor may recommend that for your first dose, you take 2 tablets of trimethoprim. You should always take your full course of trimethoprim antibiotics.

    "question": "What is bacterial vaginosis?",
    "answer": "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition caused by an imbalance of the natural bacteria in the vagina that causes unusual vaginal discharge. This natural bacteria is essential for good vaginal health, but too much or an imbalance can lead to BV, which can be uncomfortable and may require treatment. BV can occur at any age, but it’s more common for sexually active people. While having sex can make it easier to develop BV, it is not considered a sexually transmitted infection (STI) as it is not spread directly through having sex. Having BV can increase your risk of catching STIs, so it’s important to get it treated if you think you might have it. You should also take an STI test if you’re sexually active.How common is bacterial vaginosis?Bacterial vaginosis is a very common condition, with studies showing it may affect up to 29% of women globally. While it can affect anyone of any age, it’s been found to be significantly more common in sexually active people. It’s also quite common in people who are pregnant, with a study showing around 12% of pregnant women in the UK will get it at some point during their pregnancy.",

This can lead to an imbalance and BV.3.You use a copper IUDStudies show that people who use copper IUDs have an increased risk of developing BV, with 1 study finding the rate of BV increased from 27% to 44% within 6 months of insertion of a copper IUD. 4.You use scented or perfumed products on your vaginaScented perfumes and soaps can encourage more bacteria to grow, which can lead to an imbalance, causing bacterial vaginosis.

    "question": "What are the symptoms of BV?",
    "answer": "The main symptoms of bacterial vaginosis are:Unusual vaginal discharge: This often has a strong fishy smell, which is more common after sex.Changes to the colour and consistency of your discharge: This may become a greyish-white colour and become thin and watery.It’s also important to remember that nearly half of all women who get bacterial vaginosis won’t show any symptoms at all, so you may not realise you have it right away. The symptoms of bacterial vaginosis can also be similar to some STIs, like chlamydia and gonorrhoea, so you may also want to consider getting tested for an STI if you have these symptoms and you’re concerned.Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any itching or soreness. If you're experiencing symptoms like this, you may have a different infection or condition and may need a test.How long does bacterial vaginosis last?Without treatment, bacterial vaginosis can last weeks or even months before it clears up, and even then, it may continue to reoccur. Whereas, with appropriate treatment, most cases of BV clear up within 5 to 7 days. While BV can be treated very effectively, it’s also likely to return if you are susceptible to it or continue doing things that may trigger it. Around half of women who treat their BV get it again within a year. Some women also experience chronic or recurrent BV, which can continue to return a few weeks after treatment. Your doctor can provide an antibiotic gel that you can use for a few months to stop it from coming back if you get it more than 4 times in a year.",

    "question": "How do I know if I have BV?",

Your doctor should be able to help rule out any other conditions that could be causing your symptoms or suggest further testing if you need it.

    "question": "How is bacterial vaginosis treated?",
    "answer": "Bacterial vaginosis is usually treated with antibiotics. These can be in the form of tablets, pessaries (a tablet inserted directly into your vagina), creams and gels. MetronidazoleThis is a common antibiotic used to treat bacterial vaginosis but is also used to treat other types of infections like trichomoniasis. It works to eliminate the bacteria imbalance causing your BV. Metronidazole is very effective, working for over 90% of people who take it, clearing up their BV within 7 days.Dalacin creamDalacin cream is a vaginal cream applied using an applicator for 7 nights. It contains clindamycin, which works to eliminate the bacteria that cause BV. Dalacin cream has been found to treat 75% of BV cases, clearing up symptoms within a few days. It can also help prevent the chance of recurrence.Zidoval (metronidazole gel)Zidoval is a vaginal gel that contains the active ingredient metronidazole. It works in the same way as metronidazole tablets, except it’s a gel that you apply daily using an applicator. It’s considered to be a very effective way of dealing with BV, clearing up 91% of cases within 5 days.How effective is bacterial vaginosis treatment?Antibiotic bacterial vaginosis treatments are considered the most effective, with treatments like metronidazole working for over 90% of people who take it. These treatments have been shown to effectively deal with bacterial vaginosis within 5 to 7 days of use.“To get the most out of BV treatment, it’s important to take it as directed. You should also avoid having sex, smoking, using perfumed soap products, and wearing tight clothing while taking your treatment to help restore your vagina's natural balance so the infection can clear up faster.” — Dr Brenda Ikeji, Medical Editor How to take bacterial vaginosis treatmentIf you’re taking a tablet, you can take it as either: a single higher-dose taken all at oncea normal-dose, daily tablet over the course of a weekWhile both are effective, you may experience fewer side effects on the normal-dose tablets.If you are using a cream or gel Administered at home with an applicator, just before you go to bed. The applicator is filled with your treatment and slowly inserted into your vagina. The applicator is then used to deliver the treatment inside your vagina. You will receive full instructions with your treatment on how to take it and use the applicator.Can bacterial vaginosis go away on its own?Bacterial vaginosis can go away on its own, but this isn’t always the case. It may take several weeks or even months before it does and may cause uncomfortable symptoms during this time. By not treating it, you’re also increasing your risk of any complications it might cause. Due to this, it’s better to get it treated quickly rather than hoping for it to get better on its own.What happens if I leave my bacterial vaginosis untreated?If you leave bacterial vaginosis untreated, it can lead to complications like:an increased risk of contracting STIs like herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and HIVpelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is caused by the bacteria infecting the uterus or fallopian tubes If you’re pregnant with BV and do not get it treated, it can lead to complications with your pregnancy like:late miscarriagepreterm labour and deliverypreterm premature rupture of membranesspontaneous abortionlow birthweight babypostpartum endometritispost-caesarean delivery wound infectionspost-surgical infectionsWhile these complications are very rare, it’s always better to get BV treated rather than taking a risk.

    "question": "Can bacterial vaginosis be prevented?",
    "answer": "BV can be prevented, however, some people are more likely to get it due to sensitivities. The best way to prevent BV is by making sure you practice good vaginal health and hygiene while avoiding things that are known to trigger it. 1.Practice good vaginal hygiene by:avoiding douching, which can increase your risk of developing BVwiping from front to back after using the toiletchanging liners, pads, or tampons regularly (every few hours or so, depending on your flow)avoiding scented or deodorising vaginal products and only washing your vagina with water and/or unscented soapavoiding washing your underwear with strong, scented products2.Avoid tight-fitting underwearUnderwear can affect vaginal health, and tight underwear has been linked to an increased risk of BV. Try wearing more breathable underwear or going without it at night.Practice safe sexUnprotected sex, changing partners and oral sex have all been linked to an increased chance of developing BV. This is because you are introducing new bacteria to your vagina. By using condoms or other forms of barrier contraception, you can limit this.De-stressOne study in 2018 found links between cortisol (the stress hormone) and BV. While we know stress can be unavoidable, there are strategies you can use to reduce it, like deep breathing and meditation. 3.Try taking probioticsSome research suggests taking certain probiotics can help reduce your likelihood of developing BV or it recurring after antibiotic treatment.If you've had BV before, it's worth thinking about what might have caused it or if there's anything you did differently that could have led to it so you can make changes and hopefully avoid it recurring.",

    "question": "Why do I have white clumpy discharge after using metronidazole gel?",
    "answer": "White clumpy discharge is a normal occurrence after using metronidazole gel, and can sometimes happen as a side effect of the treatment. This is because the balance of bacteria in your vagina is changing, which can cause your discharge to temporarily appear white or clumpy. Some people get a fungal infection called thrush after using metronidazole gel, which can also cause white and clumpy discharge that looks like cottage cheese. Thrush occurs because the antibiotics in Zidoval also kill the normal harmless bacteria that help to keep the vaginal environment healthy and protect against thrush. If this happens to you, speak to your doctor about thrush treatment. This change in vaginal discharge is temporary, and usually clears up on its own within a few days. If it lasts longer than this, it is more likely to be caused by thrush, and you may need antifungal treatment.",

You may begin to experience symptoms like hot flushes, mood changes, vaginal dryness, and irregular periodsmenopause You are considered to be experiencing the menopause if you’ve not had a period for 12 months straight, without other possible causes like illness, medication, pregnancy or breastfeeding. The average age when a woman starts menopause in the UK is 51post-menopause This is the time after you’ve had no periods for 12 straight months.

    "question": "How does the menopause test work?",
    "answer": "The menopause test is a simple blood test. Your blood sample will be used to test your follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. This will show whether you have gone through the menopause.The kit contains three lancets, which are used to prick the skin so you can collect a blood sample. There are also full instructions included in the kit.Wash your hands with warm, soapy water. The test is easier to do if your fingers are warmDry your handsUse one of the swabs to wipe one of your fingertips. It’s a good idea to use the middle or ring finger of the hand you do not write withWait until the fingertip is dryTwist and remove the purple stick from a lancet. Place it in the middle of your fingertip, and press down the purple button at the endA small drop of blood should start to form on your fingertip. If this does not work on the first go, you can try again with the other two other lancetsUse the tissue to wipe the first drop of blood away, then pick up the collection tubePoint your finger downwards and squeeze the sides of your fingertip to get another drop of blood into the collection tubeKeep doing this until you fill the tube to the top line. If you cannot get enough blood to fill the tube, use the extra lancets on another finger, repeating the steps aboveOnce you’ve finished, use the plaster to cover your fingertipPut the lid on the collection tube and screw it on tightlyWrite your details on the sticky label. This is an important step as the lab need these details to be able to do your testPut the label on the collection tube and put the tube into the wallet. Then put the wallet into the prepaid envelopePost the sample to our labYour results, along with advice from our doctors, will be in your account two to three days after your sample arrives at the lab",

    "question": "When should you take the menopause test?",
    "answer": "The best time to take the menopause test is on day 3 of your period if you’re still experiencing them. Otherwise you can test on any day. In the peri-menopause, while your periods are becoming more irregular, your FSH levels can change a lot day by day, so it is possible to get a normal result even if you are having some of the symptoms of menopause.The test cannot tell you when your periods are going to stop, but can be helpful in diagnosing early menopause.The test can also be useful if you’re over 50 and have been using progesterone-only contraception. If your contraception means that you do not have periods anyway, the test is a useful way to find out if you’ve gone through the menopause already.We don’t recommend taking the test if you’re using the combined contraceptive pill, or you’re already having HRT.",

For many women, it provides an important and positive improvement to their quality of life. It can also help to prevent developing osteoporosis.HRT does come with some risks and it is important to discuss both the benefits and possible side effects with a doctor.",

  {
    "question": "What are the different types of HRT?",
    "answer": "There are two different types of HRT: systemic and local (vaginal) treatments. Local treatments are applied directly to the vagina and treat vaginal dryness. Systemic treatments affect all of the body (your whole system) and treat more of the symptoms that menopause can cause.Local vaginal treatments are oestrogen-only and usually come in the form of a cream or pessary. With systemic treatments, you can be prescribed either oestrogen-only (no progesterone) or combined HRT (oestrogen and progesterone).Oestrogen-only This is used if:you’ve had your womb removed (a hysterectomy) as you do not need progesterone which protects the lining of the wombCombined HRT This is given in two different ways (if you still have your womb):continuous combined HRT – oestrogen and progesterone are taken together daily and continuouslysequential or cyclical HRT – oestrogen-only, usually for about half a cycle then both hormones for the other halfNon-HRT menopause treatmentsThere is a new treatment available for menopause that isn’t HRT. This is called Veoza and contains the active ingredient fezolinetant. It can be used to treat hot flushes (also called hot flashes) and is recommended for women with moderate to severe symptoms. It’s a prescription-only medication available privately from January 2024. It may take a little longer to be available on the NHS.Veoza doesn’t contain any hormones. Instead, it works on the parts of your brain that regulate body temperature, which can prevent hot flushes. Veoza may be suitable if:you can’t take HRTyou’re getting unpleasant or ongoing side effects from HRTyou want a non-hormonal alternative treatment for menopausehot flushes are your primary menopause symptomYou can order Veoza with ZAVA.",

    "question": "What are the different ways you can have HRT?",
    "answer": "HRT comes in tablets, patches, creams, gels, pessaries, or vaginal rings.ZAVA offers a range of these treatments:continuous combined tabletscontinuous combined patchesvaginal oestrogen (local HRT)tibolonecontinuous and cyclical patches and tabletsThe current indications for HRT are:If you have menopausal symptoms and the benefit of using HRT outweighs the risksIf you suffer from early menopause (before the age of 45) *Please note our service may not currently provide HRT to women suffering from early menopauseFor women under 60 who have a strong family history or at risk of osteoporosisThere are 2 main types of HRT:CyclicalContinuousCyclical HRTThis is recommended for you if your last menstrual period was less than a year ago, or if you are still having periods, but have significant symptoms of the menopause.This HRT allows you to have a monthly bleed not too different from being on the contraceptive pill.Continuous HRTThis is recommended for you if your last menstrual period was more than a year ago, or if you have been on cyclical HRT for more than a year.This HRT may cause irregular bleeding but will eventually lead to no bleeding.We offer the following types of HRT:Continuous HRT as combined patchesThese are patches worn on the skin.Evorel Conti, each patch contains 3.2mg of estradiol hemihydrate (oestrogen) and 11.2mg norethisterone acetate (progesterone). Available in pack sizes of 8 (1 month), 16 (2 months), or 24 (3 months) patchesThe patch should be applied to a clean, non-hairy area of skin below the waist and replaced with a new patch every 3—4 days using a different site.This is for women who have not had a period for at least a year and are suffering significant symptoms. It may also be advised for women who are at high risk of osteoporosis. It should only be continued for as long as the benefits outweigh the risks.Continuous HRT as an oestrogen patch and progesterone capsuleAs an alternative to Evorel Conti, we also offer a combination of Estradot patches and Utrogestan capsules.Estradot contains various strengths of Estradiol, an oestrogen absorbed via a transdermal patch.It can come in the following strengths:25 microgram/24 hrs37.5 microgram/24 hrs50 microgram /24 hrs,75 microgram/24 hrs100 microgram/24 hrsIt is available in a 1 month (8 patches), 2 months (16 patches) or 3 months (24 patches) supply. The patch should be applied to a clean, non-hairy area of skin below the waist and replaced with a new patch every 3—4 days using a different site.Utrogestan is a progesterone-only capsule. It comes in 100mg capsules and is available as a pack of 30. For Continuous HRT it is taken at a dose of 100mg every night.Cyclical HRT as an oestrogen patch and progesterone capsuleEstradot contains various strengths of Estradiol, an oestrogen absorbed via a transdermal patch.It can come in the following strengths:25 microgram/24 hrs37.5 microgram/24 hrs50 microgram /24 hrs75 microgram/24 hrs100 microgram/24 hrsIt is available in 1 month (8 patches), 2 months (16 patches) or 3 months (24 patches) supply. The patch should be applied to a clean, non-hairy area of skin below the waist and replaced with a new patch every 3—4 days using a different site.Utrogestan is a progesterone-only capsule. For cyclical use where you continue to have a vaginal bleed, it is usually taken at a dose of 200mg daily at night for 12 days per month. It should be taken on the same 12 days each month.This treatment works in a similar way to Evorel Conti but the progesterone is taken via a pill while the patch contains oestrogen only. With this treatment option, there is likely to be less of a risk of breast cancer and thrombosis.We offer this treatment as both continuous treatment and cyclical treatment as described above.Continuous combined tabletsThese are taken as one oral tablet daily (preferably at the same time each day) without any break. This means that you will not have a monthly bleed. Each tablet contains a synthetic version of both oestrogen and progesterone. They are prescribed for treating symptoms in post-menopausal women with a womb.Elleste Duet ContiKliovance, 1mg of estradiol hemihydrate (oestrogen) and 0.5mg of norethisterone acetate (progesterone). Available in pack sizes of 84 tablets (3 months)Premique, low dose 0.3mg of conjugated oestrogens (a mix of ten types of synthetic oestrogen hormones) and 1.5mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (progesterone). Available in pack sizes of 84 tablets (3 months)Elleste Duet Conti and Kliovance are also prescribed for the prevention of osteoporosis in menopausal women who are likely to have bone problems and where other treatments are not tolerated or not safe to take.Continuous combined patchesThese are patches worn on the skin.Evorel Conti Each patch contains 3.2mg of estradiol hemihydrate (oestrogen) and 11.2mg norethisterone acetate (progesterone). Available in pack sizes of 8 (1 month), 16 (2 months), or 24 (3 months) patchesVaginal oestrogen (local HRT)Local HRT works for specific symptoms such as vaginal dryness. It will not improve other symptoms such as hot flushes or protect against longer-term effects of the menopause, like osteoporosis. These can be used for women with or without a womb, to help with vaginal symptoms.Vagifem, inserted into the vagina, these tablets contain estradiol hemihydrate equivalent to 10mcg of estradiol (oestrogen). The initial dose is one vaginal tablet daily for two weeks. After the first two weeks you use a maintenance dose of one vaginal tablet twice a week.Ovestin, a vaginal cream. Each gram contains 1mg of estriol (oestrogen). It’s applied with an applicator that provides a 0.5g dose. It’s prescribed for vaginal dryness in peri- and post-menopausal women. It is also prescribed before surgery for vaginal operations. The initial dose is usually one applicator-dose daily for two to three weeks. After this you use a maintenance dose of one applicator-dose twice a week.Estriol Cream, this is the generic version of Ovestin. It contains the same hormones in the same strength and can be used in the same way as Ovestin.Tibolone Tibolone, a synthetic steroid (with the brand name Livial) that works similarly to taking a combined HRT. It’s prescribed for symptoms in post-menopausal women or to prevent osteoporosis in post-menopausal women who are likely to have bone problems and where other treatments are not safe. Each tablet contains 2.5mg of tibolone and is taken daily by mouth, preferably at the same time each day. Available in pack sizes of 28, 84, and 168 tablets.",

The type of HRT that is recommended for you might be different depending on when you had your last period and what kind of symptoms you’re having. It’s generally recommended to use HRT at the lowest dose for the shortest time possible.Current research shows that you should start thinking about HRT treatment before the age of 60, or within 10 years of your menopause, as this time frame indicates the most benefit in comparison to the risks.Women over 60 do not usually start HRT as the likely benefit is limited. Speak to your doctor for more advice as you may be able to use a low dose HRT patch.",

    "question": "How does Vagifem work?",
    "answer": "Menopause symptoms, including those that affect the vagina, are typically caused by low oestrogen levels. Vagifem provides relief by raising oestrogen levels in the vagina using an artificial type of oestrogen called estradiol. As the oestrogen (estradiol) in Vagifem is administered directly to the vagina, you’re less likely to experience side effects in other areas of the body than you might with other types of HRT, such as tablets you take by mouth.How long does Vagifem last?Vagifem's effects should last until you stop taking it. You’ll typically take Vagifem until you feel better, and clinical trials suggest it’s safe for most women to take for up to a year. If you want to take Vagifem for longer than a year, it’s recommended to have a physical check-up with a doctor first.How long does Vagifem take to work? Vagifem starts to work as soon as you apply it. The vaginal tablet should dissolve slowly after you have inserted it. However, it can sometimes take between 8 to 12 weeks to feel the full effect. How effective is Vagifem?Vagifem is an effective treatment for vaginal menopause symptoms. Many women notice a significant improvement in their symptoms after taking Vagifem for 12 weeks, but some people see an improvement in as little as 2 weeks.",

    "question": "How to use Vagifem",
    "answer": "Vagifem comes as a vaginal tablet with an applicator. Insert 1 tablet into your vagina every night before bed for the first 2 weeks of treatment using the applicator. After the first 2 weeks, you should insert 1 vaginal tablet twice a week, leaving 3 to 4 days between doses, unless instructed otherwise by your doctor.To use Vagifem, you should:Take an applicator, which looks like a long, thin plastic stick with a tablet on 1 end.Unwrap the applicator at the end where the plunger is (not the tablet end).Apply a little water-based lubricant to your vagina if it feels sore or dry to make sure this process is as comfortable as possible. Get in a comfortable position and place the tablet end of the applicator into your vagina.Push the applicator into your vagina and stop when you feel some resistance.Push the plunger, which is at the other end of the applicator outside of your vagina, until you feel a click. This means the tablet is inserted into your vagina. Gently take the applicator out of your vagina and throw it in the bin.The tablet will stay inside if you lie down straight away, to give it time to stick to the wall of your vagina so you can absorb the medicine.How long do you need to take Vagifem for?You can take Vagifem for as long as it’s improving your symptoms unless a doctor advises you to stop. You should expect your symptoms to improve within 3 months – if you do not notice an improvement, speak to your doctor as you may need to try an alternative treatment. Vagifem has been tested in clinical trials for up to a year, so it’s typically safe to take the medication for this long. If you stop Vagifem and your symptoms come back, it may be possible to take it for longer if your doctor agrees. You’ll usually need a physical examination every year while you take Vagifem.What if I miss a dose of Vagifem?If you miss a dose of Vagifem, insert the medication as soon as you remember. You must not take a double dose to make up for one you’ve missed.What if I take too much Vagifem?If you take more Vagifem than recommended, it’s important to contact a doctor or pharmacist for advice. As it’s a low-dose vaginal medication, a high dose is usually needed for serious side effects to occur. If you do get side effects, this may include: dizzinessdrowsinesstenderness of the breastsvomiting",

    "answer": "Estriol cream treats the vaginal symptoms of menopause – it is a common choice of topical treatment used to treat symptoms such as vaginal inflammation, dryness and painful sex.

Estriol is a type of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) which helps women to manage their symptoms better by replacing the declining hormones.How does it work? – topical HRT like Estriol improves symptoms affecting the vagina, which are caused by a lack of oestrogen. The active ingredient in the cream is estriol, which is a type of oestrogen. It is one of three main oestrogens produced by your body. This adds extra oestrogen to your vagina, which helps to relieve symptoms.How do you use it? – the cream comes in a pack with a clear plastic applicator, which is used to apply the cream into your vagina. The applicator has a ring marked on the body which indicates where you need to fill the cream up to for the correct dose.

    "question": "What is Gina",
    "answer": "Gina is a low-dose vaginal oestrogen tablet that belongs to a group of medications called hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which help deal with symptoms of menopause. It contains the active ingredient estradiol hemihydrate, an artificial version of the hormone oestrogen, to replace the naturally falling levels that occur during menopause. Gina is suitable for women who are older than 50 and have not had a period in at least 1 year. It’s a local vaginal HRT, which means it treats the area it has been applied to rather than circulating in your bloodGina tablets arrive pre-loaded into an applicator, which you insert into your vagina to release the tablet. Once inserted, the tablet dissolves, releasing oestrogen directly into your vaginal tissue. This works to replace the hormones that have been reduced by menopause.What is Gina used for?Gina is used to treat vaginal atrophy or urogenital atrophy, which is one of the most common symptoms of menopause. Vaginal atrophy is the clinical term used to describe when you get vaginal symptoms such as: drynesssorenessitchingburningpain during sex spotting or bleeding, especially during/after sexVaginal atrophy tends to happen because of low oestrogen levels, which decline naturally during menopause, causing thinning of the tissue surrounding your vagina. Gina replaces the oestrogen you’ve lost, helping to improve or get rid of your symptoms.Please note that use in women under 50 or who are not postmenopausal is an ‘off-label’ use for Gina. All medications we offer are fully licensed within the UK. Some medications, such as this one, are prescribed for conditions or circumstances that are outside the license, also known as ‘off-label’. Prescribing ‘off-label’ is a common practice by healthcare professionals to ensure a medication can safely benefit as many patients as possible. This is always based on updated information and evidence since the product first became available.",

    "question": "How does Gina work?",
    "answer": "Gina is a form of HRT, which means it works by replacing the hormones you naturally lose as you go through menopause. It does this by releasing additional oestrogen into your vaginal tissue, which stops you from developing uncomfortable symptoms caused by a decline in your natural oestrogen levels.How long does Gina last?Once inserted into your vagina, Gina tablets take around 8 hours to dissolve, but the effects of Gina continue after they have dissolved. You should continue to feel the positive impact of using Gina for as long as you continue to use it.How long does Gina take to work?Gina starts working immediately, but you may not feel its full effects until you have been taking it for at least 4 to 8 weeks. It’s important to remember that how long it takes Gina to work can vary from person to person. Still, if you do not notice any benefits after 3 months of continued use, you should speak to your doctor, who may recommend a more suitable alternative treatment.How effective is Gina?Gina tablets have been proven to effectively treat symptoms of menopause like vaginal dryness, itching, and soreness. After 12 weeks of treatments with a 10mcg vaginal estradiol tablet, there was a 13% increase in healthy, mature cells lining the vaginal wall compared to 4% in people given a placebo. National guidelines recommend Gina as a low-dose vaginal oestrogen tablet if you are going through menopause and need help managing your symptoms.",

Gently press the ‘applicator plunger’ all the way in to release the tablet.Remove the applicator from your vagina and throw it away.How long do you need to take Gina tablets for?Most people will take HRT for 2 to 5 years to relieve their symptoms, but you may need to take it for longer. Gina can be used for as long as you need it if you have not experienced any uncomfortable, harmful side effects while taking it. You should speak to your doctor at least once per year to check that vaginal HRT is still suitable for you. What if I miss a Gina tablet?If you forget a Gina dose, take it as soon as you remember, but you must not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten one. What if I take too many Gina tablets?Taking more Gina than you should is unlikely to be harmful in the short term, but if you feel that your dose is too strong or weak for you, speak to your doctor or pharmacist. You should not increase your dose of Gina.",

    "question": "Alternative HRT treatment",
    "answer": "HRT is available in several forms, including oral tablets, patches, and vaginal creams. At ZAVA, we can prescribe a range of alternative HRT treatments to meet your needs.Vaginal HRT creams and tabletsIf you are getting local vaginal symptoms, such as dryness, itching, and irritation, there are several alternative creams and tablets available. At ZAVA, we can provide:Estriol cream Estriol cream, also available under the brand name Ovestin, is a prescription-only medication that is applied directly inside the vagina and contains the active ingredient estriol, a synthetic type of oestrogen. It works similarly to Gina because it replaces the falling hormone levels you experience during menopause. Estriol cream can be used on its own or alongside other forms of HRT, like patches and tablets, to treat wider menopause symptoms. VagifemVagifem, like Gina, is a vaginal oestrogen tablet which contains estradiol and works to treat vaginal dryness and irritation. However, Vagifem is only available by prescription and may contain different non-active ingredients. HRT oral tabletsOral HRT tablets are one of the most common forms of HRT available. They’re usually taken once a day and are available as oestrogen-only and combined pills (also containing an artificial progesterone). At ZAVA, we can prescribe the following HRT tablets:Elleste Duet ContiElleste Duet Conti is a continuous form of HRT that contains synthetic versions of oestrogen and progesterone. It’s taken without a break and can relieve symptoms, such as hot flushes, night sweats, and mood shifts. Femoston Conti Femoston Conti is another continuous method of HRT that contains 1mg of estradiol (oestrogen) and 5mg of dydrogesterone (progesterone). It’s also available in a lower 0.5mg/2mg dose, which may be more suitable for you if the higher strength is difficult to tolerate. Kliofem A combination of oestrogen and progesterone that is taken daily without a break. It’s also available in a lower dose under the brand name Kliovance. PremiqueA combined HRT that contains a low dose of artificial oestrogen and synthetic progesterone. It can relieve menopause symptoms in postmenopausal people. Tibolone Also available under the brand name Livial, the active ingredient, tibolone, is an artificial hormone that is broken down by the body to produce substances that mimic the hormones oestrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. HRT patchesSkin patches are another form of HRT that delivers artificial hormones locally through the skin to relieve menopause symptoms. They are a convenient alternative to oral tablets, especially for anyone who has difficulty swallowing pills or who has experienced side effects from oral medication. At ZAVA, we offer the following HRT patches:Evorel SequiA sequential or cyclical type of HRT, which contains 2 different types of patches that you switch between to deliver a controlled level of hormones through your skin. Evorel Conti Evorel Conti is a combined HRT that delivers estradiol (oestrogen) and norethisterone (progesterone) through the skin and is changed twice a week. Evorel Conti patches are worn continuously without a break.We also provide Estradot patches, which only contain synthetic oestrogen and a separate progesterone-only HRT pill called Utrogestan. Some people prefer to take HRT in this way. Estradot patches are also smaller than Evorel, making them a preferable choice for anyone who may be conscious about wearing a patch. Examples that we offer include:Estradot and Utrogestan sequentialEstradot and Utrogestan continuousFinding the right HRT is not always easy, but we’re here to help. During your consultation, your doctor will note down your preferred treatment but may recommend an alternative that’s more suitable for your health and needs.Can I buy Gina over the counter?Yes. Gina is available to purchase without a prescription because vaginal atrophy, which Gina treats, can be diagnosed based on your symptoms without needing a doctor to examine you. Also, as Gina is a low-dose medication, your chances of getting harmful side effects are very low. This means you can buy it over the counter, but you will have to answer a few questions so the pharmacist can make sure it’s safe and suitable for you.Can I get Gina on the NHS?Yes. You can get Gina on the NHS, but you may need a consultation with your GP and a prescription. Your doctor may decide a different HRT is more suitable for you.",

The progesterone contained in Evorel Conti is not body identical, but is required to prevent a build-up of your womb lining and is still a safe medication to take when prescribed to you.",

    "question": "What this test can detect",
    "answer": "This menopause test kit detects the level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in your blood.During your menstrual cycle, your levels of FSH will increase. This signals your ovaries to produce oestrogen.When there’s enough oestrogen, the pituitary gland in your brain will stop sending FSH to your ovaries. Your levels of oestrogen go up just before ovulation, which is when your ovaries release an egg.As you approach menopause, you’ll have less oestrogen produced by your ovaries and fewer eggs to release. When FSH tries to signal your ovaries to produce oestrogen, there’ll be less to release. As there’s not enough oestrogen your pituitary gland will keep producing FSH. This causes your levels of FSH to keep increasing.Your FSH levels can fluctuate throughout menopause. This means your test result may come back as normal despite having symptoms of menopause.It’s important to remember that menopause is not confirmed with just a single blood test or symptom. Your doctor will take into account the whole picture before confirming if you’re going through menopause.If you’re already taking HRT or the combined contraceptive pill, you should not use the menopause test kit. HRT and combined pills contain oestrogen which can alter your levels of FSH and give you a false test result.",

You should speak to your doctor about HRT or other treatments that will help you manage the symptoms of menopause.If you’re taking contraceptive medication, do not stop taking them if your test result comes back positive. There’s still a chance you can get pregnant if you come off contraceptives, even if you’re going through menopause.If you get a negative test result but are getting symptoms of menopause, you may be going through perimenopause.Perimenopause happens in the months or years leading up to menopause. Your oestrogen levels will reduce over time but may fluctuate on a day to day basis. You may get irregular periods when you are perimenopausal.Whether you’re going through perimenopause or menopause, your risk of heart disease increases. Oestrogen has a positive effect on your cholesterol (fat) levels. This means when your oestrogen drops during menopause, your cholesterol levels can increase.High cholesterol levels can increase the build up of fat in your arteries which can lead to symptoms like chest pain or heart attacks. Remember to get regular check ups of your blood pressure and cholesterol levels if you’re going through menopause.",

Once you start treatment, it will normally clear up in a few days.Thrush is not a sexually transmitted infection (STI) as it is rarely spread through sex.Vaginal thrushCandida is naturally found in the vagina. However, if it multiplies it can cause vaginal thrush. Around 75% of women will experience vaginal thrush at least once in their life. Vaginal thrush can lead to symptoms like:thick, white discharge that looks like cottage cheeseitchiness, soreness, stinging, and irritation of the vulva and vagina, which may get worse when you pee or during sexOral thrushOral thrush can affect men and women. It’s especially common in babies, whose immune systems are not fully formed yet, and older people, whose immune systems have weakened with age. It’s caused by the build up of candida in the mouth.

Oral thrush symptoms Oral thrush can look like white, creamy patches or spots on the tongue, inner cheeks, and sometimes the gums or roof of the mouth. These patches may look like cottage cheese. Common symptoms of oral thrush include:a loss of taste cracks in the corner of the mouthpain, irritation, or redness under denturesa dry mouthIn babies oral thrush can look like a layer of white across the tongue that does not easily wipe off. They may also not want to feed, or be fussy when feeding. If you think your baby has oral thrush, speak to your doctor for treatment.

    "question": "How to get rid of thrush",
    "answer": "Thrush can be treated with over-the-counter antifungal medication, such as clotrimazole or fluconazole, in the form of tablets or creams. Antifungal medications work by killing the yeast that causes the infection. Clotrimazole is the generic name for Canesten and other thrush or antifungal medications. It can be applied as a cream, both internally and externally, or taken as a tablet that is put into the vagina (a pessary). For oral thrush, antifungal medication can also be used in the form of mouthwash or gel. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that can be used to help treat thrush. It can also be used to help prevent thrush in people who get it repeatedly. It’s usually used in the form of tablets or liquid that you take by mouth. How effective is thrush treatment Thrush treatments like clotrimazole or fluconazole are normally highly effective. They can help improve symptoms within a few days, with most symptoms clearing up within 7 days. It is recommended to keep using the medication for 14 days to help stop thrush returning, but you should not use clotrimazole for longer than 14 days unless you are told to by a doctor.Thrush can come back after treatment. If you're experiencing recurrent thrush (more than 4 times in a year) you should speak to your doctor to help find the best treatment and rule out any underlying conditions that are causing it. Types of thrush treatmentThrush can be treated using a mix of internal and external treatments, including clotrimazole creams and fluconazole oral tablets. Clotrimazole creamThrush can be treated using clotrimazole cream, which can be found as a generic treatment, or under the brand name Canesten Cream. There are internal and external creams which can be used together to treat the infection and soothe the symptoms. Clotrimazole creams kill the fungus that is causing the infection by creating holes in the cell membrane. Clotrimazole internal cream is used once a day at bedtime. It is applied with an applicator. You put the applicator into your vagina as far as you comfortably can. Then you slowly push the plunger until it stops and then remove the applicator. Make sure to follow the instructions provided carefully.External creams can be used 2 to 3 times a day for 14 days by applying a thin layer to the affected areas and rubbing it in gently with your finger. External creams treat the symptoms of thrush but not the underlying yeast infection so it’s recommended to use with an internal cream or pessary treatment.Treatment usually works within a few days, but it’s best to continue treatment for 14 days to help stop it coming back.Clotrimazole pessariesThrush treatments that contain pessaries, such as Canesten Combi, should be used at bedtime and are used in a similar way to internal creams. You put the pessary into the applicator, following the instructions provided. Lay on your back with your knees bent and gently insert the applicator as far as you comfortably can. Slowly push the plunger until it stops and then remove the applicator.Do not swallow a pessary, they are for vaginal use only. Symptoms should start to clear within a few days. FluconazoleFluconazole is an antifungal medication that kills the yeast that causes thrush. It’s sometimes used to help prevent infection in people who experience recurrent thrush. Fluconazole is available over-the-counter and on prescription. Fluconazole can be taken as an oral tablet or liquid. It can sometimes be taken as an injection but this is usually given at a hospital. Fluconazole can be taken together with an external clotrimazole cream to relieve symptoms straight away until the capsule starts working, such as with Canesten Duo or a generic alternative. The dose of fluconazole tablets depends on the type of thrush. For oral thrush, 50mg tablets are taken once a day and symptoms should improve within 7 days, but if the infection is serious it may take 1 to 2 weeks to fully work. For vaginal thrush a 150mg tablet is taken as a single dose.You should talk to your doctor before using fluconazole if you have a heart condition or have experienced kidney or liver problems. What is the best treatment for thrush?The best treatment for thrush is an antifungal medication taken orally or applied to the skin as a cream. It’s often most effective to use a combination of an internal treatment to kill the fungus and an external cream to treat the symptoms.You should talk to your doctor about finding the best treatment for you as some treatments may not be suitable for pregnant women or people with weakened immune systems.",

    "question": "What are the side effects of thrush?",
    "answer": "A common side effect of external creams is mild skin irritation, especially at the start of treatment. This can look like:swelling, stinging, or itching of the vagina area peeling of the skinpins and needles or flaking of the skinIf an external cream is not helping to soothe and relieve symptoms, or is making them worse, it’s best to stop using it. Make sure to use an external cream alongside another treatment that will kill the fungus causing thrush. If you get severe symptoms, wash the cream off straight away with water and unfragranced soap. Common side effects of internal creams and pessaries are:swelling or discomfort in the vaginableeding from the vaginaa burning or stinging feeling lower stomach painUsually pessaries and internal creams are taken in 1 dose but can also be taken for longer. If you’re only taking a single dose, these side effects should go away within a few minutes to a few hours. If you get side effects from using internal thrush treatments, try using an oral fluconazole capsule if you get thrush again to see if this works better for you. Oral thrush treatments can have common side effects like:nausea or vomitingstomach issues such as bloating or discomfortdiarrhoeaheadaches These are usually mild and temporary. In some cases, oral thrush treatment can lead to skin rashes. In rare cases, thrush treatments can cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) and you should call 999 if:your lips, mouth, throat, or tongue become swollen you suddenly become confused, drowsy, or dizzyyour throat feels tight or you are struggling to swallowyour skin, tongue, or lips turn blue or paleIf side effects are severe, worsen, or do not stop after you stop using the treatment, you should speak to a doctor straight away. Always check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication for a full list of side effects. What to do if you get side effectsMost side effects can be managed at home and as many thrush treatments are single use, they should not last long if you do get them. You can manage side effects like:headaches by drinking water and using paracetamol and ibuprofenstomach issues by eating smaller, more frequent meals, taking your fluconazole capsule with food, and using a hot water bottle on your stomachdiarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting by drinking lots of fluids and avoiding heavy, greasy mealsskin rash by taking an antihistamine\"If you’re using a contraceptive pill and you have vomiting or diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, or within 3 to 4 hours of taking it, your contraception may not work. You should follow the instructions in your patient information leaflet and avoid having sex until your treatment is finished if possible. Sex can make thrush symptoms worse, and there’s a small chance you can pass it to your sexual partner through oral and penetrative sex. Clotrimazole cream can also damage latex in condoms or diaphragms, reducing their effectiveness.\" — Dr Brenda Ikeji, Medical Editor",

It is important to speak to a doctor even if your symptoms seem mild.Why do I keep getting thrush?Recurring thrush can be caused by an imbalance of the natural bacteria levels in the body. You may be experiencing recurrent thrush because of:antibiotic usetight clothingchronic stresssmokinga poor dietusing irritating productssexual activity treatment resistanceIf you are experiencing recurring thrush you should speak to your doctor. They can prescribe a longer course of treatment to help stop your symptoms and they may do further tests to see if there is an underlying reason that you keep getting it. Can antibiotics cause thrush?Yes, antibiotics can cause thrush as they can kill off some bacteria in the body and allow candida to overgrow. Antibiotics work by killing the bacteria causing whatever infection you’re taking them for, so while they can be beneficial for treating an infection, they can also harm the ‘good’ bacteria that keeps your candida levels in check. Some commonly known antibiotics that may cause thrush include:amoxicillintetracyclines, like doxycycline and minocyclinesome quinolones, like ciprofloxacin and levofloxacinCan you have thrush without discharge?Yes, it is possible to have thrush without discharge. If you are experiencing other symptoms of thrush, such as itching or irritation, you should speak to your doctor, even if you do not have discharge.Can you have sex with thrush?Yes, you can have sex with thrush, however it is not recommended as sex can worsen the symptoms of thrush, and potentially make them last longer. If you do have sex, it’s recommended to use extra lubricant to reduce friction and irritation. If you are treating thrush with clotrimazole creams, you should take extra care if you are using condoms as they can cause damage to the latex and make them less effective. What is the difference between thrush and BV?Thrush is a fungal infection caused by the overgrowth of yeast whereas BV is caused by a bacterial imbalance. Thrush can be treated with an antifungal medication but BV is usually treated with antibiotics. Symptoms of thrush and BV can be similar – an easy way to tell if you have thrush or BV is to look at any discharge you may have. Thrush can cause a thick white discharge that may have a mild yeasty smell or no smell at all, and BV can cause thin, watery discharge that may smell fishy.Can thrush cause a UTI?No, thrush does not cause UTIs but they can share symptoms and occur at the same time. Thrush is a fungal infection that occurs in the vaginal area whereas UTIs are caused by bacteria and affect the urinary tract.",

    "question": "How does Canesten Combi work?",
    "answer": "The active ingredient in Canesten Combi is clotrimazole, an antifungal medication that kills the thrush-causing fungus, Candida albicans. It does this by stopping an important part of the fungal cell membrane, called ergosterol, from being produced.

This causes the cellular contents to leak out, killing the fungus and helping clear the infection from the body.How long does Canesten Combi take to work?Most people notice an improvement in their symptoms within 3 days of starting Canesten Combi treatment. However, some people find it takes a little longer. If your symptoms have not improved after 7 days of starting treatment, contact your doctor for more advice.How effective is Canesten Combi?Canesten Combi is considered to be highly effective at treating vaginal thrush with most people noticing an improvement in their symptoms within 3 days of starting treatment.

    "question": "How does Canesten Cream work?",
    "answer": "Thrush is caused by an overgrowth of fungus (also called fungi). The active ingredient of Canesten Cream, clotrimazole, works by stopping the thrush-causing fungi from making ergosterol, an important chemical needed to maintain fungal cell structure. Without ergosterol, fungal cells can no longer maintain their integrity and eventually die. The symptoms of the fungal infection will then improve. How long will Canesten Cream take to work?The cream will provide some relief when applied, but it may take a few days (usually 1 to 2) for symptoms such as itching and soreness to fully improve. In clinical trials, 42% of people reported improvement in symptoms within 4 hours, and 76 to 88% of people reported symptom relief within 1 day. How effective is Canesten Cream?Canesten Cream is an effective treatment for the external itching, burning, redness, and discomfort of vaginal or vulvar thrush (also known as candidiasis). In a clinical trial, over 90% of women reported improvements in their symptoms and quality of life after using Canesten Cream.",

    "answer": "Chlamydia is diagnosed with a quick and simple test that involves taking a swab or a urine sample, depending on whether you have a penis or vagina and which area of the body you're testing for chlamydia.It’s best to take a test:2 weeks after unprotected sexual intercourse with a new partner (you did not use a condom)if you suspect a partner has chlamydiaif you experience chlamydia symptomsat least once a year if you’re sexually active and under 25 years old (even if you do not have any symptoms)2 main types of chlamydia test are used:A swab test – a small cotton swab is wiped over the area and then sent to the lab. A swab can be used to take a sample from inside the vagina, anus, mouth or throat, or the tip of the penis.A urine test – a sample of urine is collected for testing. Usually, this is the first bit of urine that comes out as it contains the most bacteria. These tests can be conducted by a healthcare professional at a GP or sexual health clinic. Alternatively, you can test yourself at home with a testing kit using ZAVA’s discreet, trusted, and regulated service.Home testing kitsZAVA offers two different chlamydia home testing kits – urine tests for if you have a penis, and swab tests for if you have a vagina or if you think you may have contracted chlamydia via the anus. Swab tests are more likely to pick up on an infection than a urine test if you may have chlamydia in your vagina or anus. To get the most accurate results, wait 2 weeks between having unprotected sex and taking a test.Urine testsUse the small bottle in the kit to catch the first bit of urine after you start urinating. Try to fill it at least halfway.Replace the lid.Secure the bottle of urine inside the bigger bottle with the absorbent paper. Seal the bottle in the airtight packaging provided and return using the prepaid envelopeVaginal swabsBreak the seal of the swab.Spread the skin of the vulva (the skin outside the vagina) and insert the swab into the vagina without letting it touch anything else. Rotate the swab inside the vagina for 10 to 15 seconds.Take it out carefully and put it straight into the tube. Seal the tube in the airtight packaging provided and return using the prepaid envelope.Your results will be sent within 1 to 3 working days of the lab receiving your test. If the result is positive, there’s a strong chance you have a chlamydia infection. You should either speak to your doctor or request chlamydia treatment using our online service. Only people with a positive test can receive chlamydia treatment.",

    "question": "What is the best treatment for chlamydia?",
    "answer": "Chlamydia is treated using antibiotics. Antibiotics kill the chlamydia trachomatis bacteria and prevent it from growing and spreading further. They are up to 95% effective if taken correctly.Doxycycline is the most common antibiotic used to treat chlamydia. Your healthcare provider may prescribe you an alternative if you are allergic to doxycycline, are pregnant or have other health needs. Another antibiotic called azithromycin used to be used to treat chlamydia, but, due to growing antibiotic resistance of azithromycin within the general population, this treatment is no longer commonly prescribed.If you’re unsure whether doxycycline is the best chlamydia treatment for you, speak to our patient care team, or contact a doctor via your patient account before ordering your antibiotics.",

    "question": "How do I take treatment for chlamydia?",
    "answer": "Doxycycline is administered in tablet form. It is recommended that you take 100mg, twice a day for 7 days. Always consult with your doctor or prescriber to ensure you’re taking an accurate dose.Take doxycycline by: swallowing the tablet whole with a glass of water or take it with food if it upsets your stomachavoiding lying down for 30 minutes after taking doxycycline as this can irritate your oesophagus (gullet)Doxycycline can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, so try to avoid strong sunlight and sunbeds while taking the medication.You must take the full course of doxycycline, even if your symptoms subside. You should avoid having sex until you’ve finished taking the full 7-day course of doxycycline to make sure your body is rid of the infection. If you have been prescribed an alternative medication, you need to follow the treatment instructions as prescribed by your doctor.It’s important to tell any current sexual partners that you’ve tested positive for chlamydia so that they can also get tested. You can do this anonymously via text at your local sexual health clinic.",

    "answer": "Chlamydia treatment is very effective, clearing 95% of infections when taken as prescribed. In most cases, if your symptoms have cleared up, no further testing is necessary.However, if you choose to retest, wait six weeks after finishing treatment as the test can remain positive during that period. If you’re still feeling chlamydia symptoms after treatment, speak to your doctor, who can advise on symptom management while you wait to retest.Reinfection is common, particularly among individuals under 25. If you’re in this age group, it’s recommended that you retest 3 to 6 months following diagnosis and treatment.",

Untreated chlamydia can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in 16% of women, with approximately 1 in 5 of those women becoming infertile as a result.In men, untreated chlamydia can cause epididymo-orchitis (inflammation of the testicles) and inflammation of the epididymis (the duct responsible for sperm transport), both of which can cause infertility.If treated with antibiotics, 95% of chlamydia cases clear up completely, avoiding any long-term health issues.",

    "answer": "We do not recommend unprotected sex, since protection like condoms can help avoid STIs and unwanted pregnancies. If you are planning to have unprotected sex, you should make sure both you and your partner are free of STIs, which means testing negative at least 3 months after the last time either of you slept with someone else.We recommend that you wait until the day after finishing your treatment for chlamydia with doxycycline before you have sex. If your partner is still undergoing treatment, you should not have sex with them until they have also finished their treatment.You should test for chlamydia every 3 to 6 months if you are sexually active and have multiple sexual partners, or if you change sexual partners. You should test more frequently than this if you are having unprotected sex with new partners. Remember, it can take up to 2 weeks for chlamydia to show up on a sexual health test, so you need to make sure you wait the appropriate amount of time between sex and testing to obtain an accurate result.",

However, if it’s nearly time for your next dose, you can skip the original dose and just take the next tablet. After that, you can resume the normal dosage cycle, such as 1 dose every 12 hours for the remainder of your treatment window. It can be helpful to set an alarm or reminder each day if you’re worried about missing your doses. Important: You must never take an extra dose to make up for a missed dose, and you should never take 2 doses at the same time. If you think you might have taken more doxycycline than recommended and are experiencing any side effects, get in touch with your GP or pharmacist.",

    "question": "What is Warticon?",
    "answer": "Warticon is a prescription-only topical genital wart treatment that contains the active ingredient podophyllotoxin. Podophyllotoxin is a plant extract and belongs to the class of medications called antivirals. By applying Warticon directly to anogenital warts, the active ingredient stops them growing and eventually kills off the wart cells.Warticon is available as a cream in 5g or 10g tubes, or as a solution which needs to be applied with an applicator, making it more difficult to use. It’s suitable for use on soft anogenital warts that appear close to the penis or externally around the vagina.",

  {
    "question": "How does Warticon work?",
    "answer": "Warticon works by killing cells infected by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is what causes genital warts. When applied directly to the affected area, it prevents them from growing and spreading any further. Podophyllotoxin, the active ingredient in Warticon, is a potent plant extract which is also an antiviral. When applied directly to the surface of a wart, podophyllotoxin stops wart cells dividing and multiplying. Eventually, this causes the wart cells to be destroyed and replaced with healthy tissue. How long does Warticon last?A 1-week course of Warticon consists of applying Warticon twice a day for 3 days, followed by 4 days of applying no cream or solution. This 1-week cycle can be repeated for up to 4 weeks.How long does Warticon take to work?Most people find that genital warts clear in 4 weeks when using Warticon, but it can take longer in some people. It’s important to keep applying Warticon cream until the warts have gone. If after 4 weeks, you still have genital warts, you should contact your doctor for further advice. How effective is Warticon?Warticon is a highly effective treatment against genital warts, and can clear up to 70% of cases.",

At ZAVA, we offer Aldara 5% cream as an alternative to Warticon cream.Aldara is another topical solution, but it contains the active ingredient imiquimod. Rather than targeting the virus responsible for causing genital warts, imiquimod works by helping your immune system to produce natural substances that help fight the virus. Clinical research shows that 60% of women experience total clearance of genital warts after an average of 8 weeks. In men, the total clearance rate was 23%, and the average time it took to achieve total clearance was 12 weeks.",

    "question": "When should I get tested for an STI?",
    "answer": "In general, we recommend getting tested for STIs if you’ve recently changed partners or think you’ve been exposed to an STI. It’s also a good idea if you have multiple partners or have unprotected sex. You should also get tested if you’re informed by a previous partner that they’ve contracted an STI, as there’s a chance you may have caught it too. Certain STIs also have different testing windows of when to test to get the most accurate results. This is because some STIs have different incubation periods (how long before the infection shows up). Remember: A lot of STIs don’t show symptoms, so it can be easy to pass them and catch them without realising it, even if you don’t have multiple partners. So, if you’re not using protection, getting tested regularly is vital, even if you feel fine.Annual testingAs a general rule, for good sexual health, we recommend anyone who has unprotected sex or new partners should be tested after each time they have unprotected sex. It’s also good practice to get tested annually for all STIs, including for HIV.",

    "question": "How to use an STI test kit at home",
    "answer": "To use your STI test kit, you will collect a sample at home; this will be either:a small amount of urinea genital, anus, or mouth swaba small amount of blood from your finger using a pinprick You will then send your samples to our partner lab for testing and analysis. How you use your test kit will depend on the type of test kit you’ve ordered and what it’s for. Your test kit will arrive with full instructions on exactly how to use it.Before collecting any sample, make sure you’ve washed and disinfected your hands thoroughly.Urine testingIf you’re taking a urine test, your test kit will arrive with 2 bottles, absorbent paper and packaging to post your sample to our lab. To take your test: Remove the smallest bottle from the packaging.Urinate inside the smaller bottle, aiming to fill it halfway. Try to use the first flow of urine as it’s more likely to contain bacteria.Once filled to the marker, reseal it and place it inside the larger bottle with the provided absorbent paper.Fill out your details label provided and stick it to your sample collection tube so it’s clearly readable. Place your sample in the pre-paid envelope for posting to our partner lab.Genital or anal swab testSwab tests will differ depending on whether you’re using a swab for a vagina, penis or anus. However, the actions you take will be similar. You will essentially use a swab to collect a sample from your genitals. Vaginal swab testRemove the swab from the seal, but do not touch the tip of the swap. Spread open the skin outside of your vagina with one hand, and use the other to point the tip of the swab toward your vagina.Insert the tip of the swab into your vagina. Make sure you do not go too deep. You shouldn’t feel any pain while collecting this sample.Rotate the swab inside your vagina for 10 to 15 seconds before removing it. Try to make sure you do not touch any other parts of your skin with the swab while using it or after removing it. Put the swab inside the provided tube and securely fasten the lid.Fill out any details required on the provided label and stick it to your sample tube as directed. You can now place your collected sample inside the prepaid envelope for posting to our lab.Penis swab testBreak the swab from its seal, making sure not to touch the tip of the swab.

Find a comfortable position. You can do this on the toilet, or bend over.Insert the swab 2 to 3cm into your anus. If it feels difficult, try twisting it to help it go in. Once inside, gently rotate the swab 5 to 10 times around the wall of your anus.Take the swab out, making sure the tip does not touch anything else, and place it inside the provided tube. Complete the details label and stick it to the tube as directed. Place the tube inside the prepaid envelope before sending it to our partner lab.Oral swab testAn oral swab test is the same as a genital swab test, but instead of collecting a sample from your genitals, you are collecting a sample from inside your mouth.Remove the swab from its packaging. Make sure you do not touch the cotton tip.Put the swab inside your mouth and rub the cotton tip against the back of your throat. Try to make sure you firmly touch both sides.Remove the swab from your mouth without touching the tip against anything else. Place the swab inside the supplied tube before sealing it.Complete your details label and stick it to the tube.Place the sample tube inside the prepaid envelope and post it to our partner lab.Blood testWhen a home test requires a blood sample, you’ll need to take a finger prick test. This involves using the provided test kit to prick the end of your finger so you can collect a few drops of blood. Remove the test kit from its packaging.Select the finger from which you want to collect blood. It’s usually best to use a finger from your non-dominant hand, as it can hurt a little afterwards. Open the blood collection tube and place it nearby.Clean your chosen finger thoroughly with the alcohol swab provided.Take out one of the provided lancets and twist and pull the purple end.Place the lancet against your fingertip and press the purple button.You will feel a sharp scratch on your fingertip. You should then notice a small drop of blood forming, which you can wipe away with a tissue. If you do not bleed, you can try again with one of the additional lancets provided.Point the tip of your finger (where the blood droplet formed) directly over the collection tube. Squeeze your finger gently to help blood fall into the tube. Fill the tube until it reaches the line shown on the tube and seal it. You can use an additional lancet if you cannot produce enough blood to fill the tube as required. Complete the details sticker provided and stick it to your collection tube as directed. Place the tube in the provided wallet before placing it in the pre-paid envelope. Your sample is now ready to be sent to our partner lab for analysis.If you are unsure about using a test kit, you can contact our Patient Care team at any time for advice and support.",

    "answer": "Most home test kits are considered as accurate or nearly as accurate as the testing you will receive in a sexual health clinic, provided you have carried out the test correctly. How accurate your test is will also depend on when you take the test and when you are exposed to an STI. Taking your test too early can result in false results, and you may require further testing. “A test kit must be above 90% accurate to be considered clinically reliable. All of the test kits we provide are clinically reliable and up to 99% effective when used properly, and at the correct time for the STI you are testing for.” – Dr Brenda Ikeji, Medical Editor",

Our doctors will provide you with these results and explain exactly what each result means, as well as what you should do next.What does a negative test result mean?A negative test result means the STI you were testing for was not detected in your sample at the time of testing.

However, your doctor may recommend repeat testing if you have not taken your test at the correct time, depending on the STI.

    "question": "What are sexually transmitted infections?",
    "answer": "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are passed on through having sex and sexual contact. They vary in severity and symptoms. While some can cause symptoms that are noticeable and difficult to manage, others can cause no symptoms whatsoever but still cause long-term health issues. We currently provide tests for:chlamydia (oral, rectal and genital)gonorrhoea (oral, rectal and genital)trichomoniasisHPVHIVsyphilishepatitis Bhepatitis Cherpes type I & IIChlamydiaThis is one of the most common STIs in the UK, with over 194,970 new cases diagnosed in 2023. It’s caused by a bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis, and it’s often symptomless, which can make it very easy to transmit and catch. When it does produce symptoms, these can include:pain when urinatingunusual vaginal dischargepain in the tummy or pelvispain during sexbleeding after sexbleeding between periodsFortunately, chlamydia is very treatable with antibiotics, which we can provide quickly and discreetly.When to test for chlamydiaYou need to wait at least 2 weeks after exposure to chlamydia to get an accurate test result. This is because it can take up to 2 weeks for a chlamydia infection to show up on a test after you’ve caught it. During these 2 weeks, you must stop having sex or practise safe sex to avoid passing on the infection.GonnorhoeaGonnorhoea is another common STI caused by a bacteria called Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It’s becoming more common, with over 85,000 new cases diagnosed in 2023, a 7.5% increase from 2022.Gonorrhoea can affect your genitals, mouth and anus and usually causes uncomfortable symptoms, which can differ in men and women. Gonorrhoea symptoms in women include:painful or burning urinationincreased vaginal dischargevaginal bleeding between periods or after sexpain in the lower abdomen Gonorrhoea symptoms in men include: painful or burning urinationwhite, yellow, or green discharge from the penispainful or swollen testicles Gonorrhoea symptoms in the anus include:dischargeanal itchingsorenessbleedingpainful bowel movements Gonorrhoea symptoms in the eyes include:eye painsensitivity to lightpus-like discharge from one or both eyes Gonorrhoea symptoms in the throat include: sore throatswollen lymph nodes in the neck Gonorrhoea symptoms in the joints include: warm, red, swollen, and extremely painful joints, especially during movement Symptoms for gonorrhoea can appear within 2 to 5 days after infection, but some can take up to a month to appear. It’s a very treatable condition, so it’s important to get tested so you can get sorted as quickly as possible.When to test for gonorrhoeaYou should wait at least 2 weeks from when you think you were exposed to gonorrhoea before getting tested. Like chlamydia, it can take up to 2 weeks for the infection to show up on a test, and getting tested sooner may not give you an accurate result.SyphilisSyphilis is another STI that’s becoming more common, with a 15% increase in new cases between 2021 and 2022. Like chlamydia, syphilis can be symptomless and go undetected for a long time, making it very easy to spread the infection. It’s also caused by bacteria, which can be treated very effectively with the right antibiotics. Syphilis symptoms vary depending on how long you’ve had the infection. In its first stages, you may notice a painless, firm, round sore that appears on the genitals, mouth, skin, or rectum. At a later stage, you can also get symptoms like: fever headache patchy hair loss swollen glands in the groin or neck a rash, often on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet white, wart-like sores (condylomata lata) As syphilis symptoms vary depending on how long you’ve had it and go away and come back, it’s essential to get tested and treated as quickly as possible, even if you think you're better. A syphilis infection will not go away on its own, and if left untreated, it can lead to potentially life-threatening complications. When to test for syphilisWhile syphilis symptoms can start to appear 2 to 3 weeks after infection, it’s best to test between 3 and 6 weeks. You often need to retest at 12 weeks after being exposed to the infection to get an accurate result. Syphilis symptoms often come and go, so it’s essential to get tested, even if you have no symptoms at all, as it does not get better on its own.HIVHIV is a virus that attacks the cells in your immune system, weakening your ability to fight other infections and diseases. This can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is the name given to a large group of potentially life-threatening illnesses that you can get when HIV has damaged your immune system.The symptoms of HIV are usually flu-like, and last for a week or 2. This can happen after 2 to 6 weeks of being infected. After this, you may not experience any symptoms, so you may not realise you have HIV, making it easier to spread the infection. If you think you’ve been exposed to HIV, it’s vital to talk to your doctor as quickly as possible. You may be eligible for PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis), which is a treatment that can stop HIV from developing even if you’ve initially caught it from unprotected sex, but you need to have this treatment within 72 hours after sex.We also provide PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), which can be taken daily or on-demand to prevent HIV when you have sex. When to test for HIVHIV is usually detected within 18 to 45 days of exposure to the infection. We recommend testing at 45 days after exposure. How likely it is to find the infection depends on when you test and what test you do. So, while in some cases, HIV can be detected within 2 weeks of infection, it’s detected in over 99.9% of cases after 12 weeks. So, we recommend waiting or retesting at this time to make sure your results are accurate.Hepatitis B and CHepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. While it can be symptomless, it can also cause symptoms like:dark urineclay-coloured stoolsfeverjoint painloss of appetitenauseastomach painvomitingBecause of this, it's important to get tested even if you don't have symptoms to avoid spreading it. It can be passed on through blood, saliva and sex. If you have acute (short-term) hepatitis B, it can go away on its own, but you might still need treatment. Chronic (long-term) hepatitis B requires treatment, which can include antiviral medication. If left untreated, Hepatitis B can lead to serious health complications, like liver damage, cirrhosis and liver cancer. Similarly, hepatitis C is also a viral infection that can affect the liver. It causes similar symptoms and is also spread through having sex. If you don't have hepatitis C, it's very treatable with the right approach, but it will not get better on its own. When to test for hepatitis B & CAcute hepatitis B symptoms usually take 1 to 4 months to appear. Hepatitis C is usually symptomless or has flu-like symptoms which are easily mistaken for a common cold. For both of these infections, we recommend testing after 3 months of exposure.TrichomoniasisTrichomoniasis is a common STI caused by a parasite called 'Trichomonas vaginalis.' It's very treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can cause health issues and increase your risk of catching HIV. While trichomoniasis is often symptomless (nearly half of people who get trichomoniasis don't show symptoms), it can cause different symptoms for men and women. Because it can be symptomless, it's always important to get tested to avoid accidentally spreading the infection to anyone else. For men, the most common symptoms include:pain when peeing or during ejaculationneeding to pee more frequently than usualthin, white discharge from the penissoreness, swelling and redness around the head of the penis or foreskinFor women, the most common symptoms include:abnormal vaginal discharge – this can be thick, thin or frothy and yellow-greenmore discharge than usual and it may also have an unpleasant fishy smellsoreness, swelling and itching around the vagina – this can also affect your inner thighs pain or discomfort when passing urine or having sexAs the symptoms of trichomoniasis can easily be confused with other STIs, it's really important to get proper testing so you can get the right treatment quickly.When to test for trichomoniasisTrichomoniasis can take around 5 to 28 days before showing up on a test. This means it’s best to wait 4 weeks to get the most accurate results.Genital herpes Genital herpes is an STI caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and most commonly herpes type 2 (HSV-2). Genital herpes can be spread through sexual contact but also skin-to-skin contact if you have any active sores. The most common symptoms of genital herpes include:small blisters that burst to leave red, open sores around your genitals, anus, thighs or anustingling, burning or itchingpain when urinatingunusual dischargeOften, genital herpes symptoms come and go, and we call this having an 'outbreak'. It's important to know that if your symptoms clear up on their own, it doesn't mean you're 'cured' and your symptoms can return. Fortunately, recurring outbreaks tend to be less severe than when you catch the infection initially, and they also become less common.With antiviral herpes treatment, you can reduce how long outbreaks take and prevent future outbreaks. If you're concerned you might have genital herpes, it's important to get tested even if you're not having an outbreak, as the infection will not get better on its own.When to test for genital herpes It can take up to 16 weeks after exposure to genital herpes for it to be detected by a test kit. We recommend testing once you notice herpes sores or a rash as this is the only way you can get an accurate result when using a swab. A local STI clinic may be able to perform a blood test to check for the virus if you do not have symptoms but think you have been exposed. Oral herpesHerpes 1 (HSV-1) commonly causes oral herpes, with symptoms like painful blisters and ulcers around the mouth. It can also be completely symptomless, leading to many people passing on the infection without realising it. Herpes symptoms tend to come and go (when you do get them), and we call these outbreaks. There are treatments available to prevent outbreaks and stop them if you have one, but there is no 'cure' to remove the infection completely.People often experience worse symptoms on their first outbreak, and these can include:feverbody achessore throat (oral herpes)headacheswollen lymph nodes near the infection.Herpes recurrent outbreaks tend to become more mild and less severe.If you’re worried that you might have herpes, we can provide rapid testing to get you answers. If you think you’re having an outbreak, you must avoid skin-to-skin contact with any sores, as this can spread the infection.When to test for oral herpesIt can take up to 16 weeks after exposure to herpes for it to be detected by a test kit. We recommend testing once you notice a herpes sore or a rash.HPVHPV is short for the human papillomavirus, which is actually the name for a large group of viruses that can cause many different health conditions, including genital herpes. As there are over 200 different types of HPV, all with varying risks associated with them, they are broken down into categories of low-risk and high-risk. Low-risk HPV is more likely to cause symptoms like warts on the genitals, anus, mouth, or throat, whereas high-risk HPV can be symptomless but can lead to conditions like cancer when left untreated. High-risk HPV has been linked to:cervical canceranal cancerpenile cancervulval cancervaginal cancersome types of head and neck cancerLike other STIs, HPV is passed on through sexual contact, so it's important to get tested if you've been exposed. Cervical screening (a test for HPV) is also offered to most women over the age of 25.When to test for HPVIt can take 6 weeks to 6 months to see symptoms of a genital HPV infection. We recommend waiting until 4 weeks after you think you’ve been exposed to HPV before testing.",

    "question": "What is syphilis?",
    "answer": "Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that’s becoming more common in the UK, with 2023 seeing the most cases of the infection since the 1930s. It is both preventable and curable with the right protection and treatment, but if left untreated, it can lead to serious complications and health issues.Syphilis is a bacterial infection, which means it is caused by a type of bacteria, in this case, Treponema pallidum. Syphilis is usually passed on through:sex, but it can also be transmitted via blood transfusionspregnancy and childbirth skin-to-skin contact with any active sores caused by the infection As syphilis is a bacterial infection, it’s very treatable with the right antibiotics, but you can also prevent it and limit its spread by practising safe sex and getting tested regularly.Syphilis symptomsThe symptoms of syphilis can take 10 to 90 days to develop, and they may be mild or even unnoticeable, which can lead to it spreading faster as people do not realise they have the infection. When it does cause symptoms, these are usually:small sores on your penis, vagina, or anus – usually, these are painless, and you may only get onesores around your mouth, lips, and hands white or grey wart-like growths, usually around your penis, vagina or anusrashes around your palms or the soles of your feet, but this can spread over the whole body, normally not itchywhite patches in your mouthhigh temperatureheadachestirednessswollen glandshair loss Stages of syphilis Syphilis appears in stages called the primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages. If left untreated, it can develop into neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, and otosyphilis, which can have severe impacts on your health.Primary stageThis is the first stage of syphilis, and it usually presents as a single sore or multiple sores, and they’re usually found where the syphilis infection started. This is most often around the:penisvaginaanusrectumlips or in the mouthSyphilis sores tend to be round, firm and painless, so they often go unnoticed. They last for around 3 to 6 weeks and can heal or disappear whether you have treatment or not. This is important, as even if syphilis sores go away, you still need to get treatment.Secondary stageAt secondary stage, syphilis causes rashes and/or more sores around your mouth, anus or vagina. This rash is most commonly found on your palms or the soles of your feet but can show up anywhere on your body. It usually occurs when sores from the primary stage are healing. A syphilis rash doesn’t tend to be itchy, and it’s usually rough and a red or brown colour. During the secondary stage, you may also experience symptoms like:feverswollen lymph glandssore throatpatchy hair lossheadachesweight lossmuscle achesfatigue (feeling very tired)Again, these symptoms can go away on their own with or without treatment, but this doesn’t mean you’ve recovered. Even if these symptoms go away, you still need treatment.Latent stageAt this stage, syphilis usually has no symptoms, and the infection can stay in your body for years without you realising it.Tertiary stageWhile most people won’t develop tertiary syphilis, it can affect a majority of your organs and cause severe health issues. It can affect your heart, blood vessels, brain and nervous system and may not occur until 10 to 30 years after your initial infection. Tertiary syphilis can be diagnosed through a range of tests and requires immediate treatment.Neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, and otosyphilisNeurosyphilis is when syphilis spreads to your brain. Its symptoms include:severe headachesmuscle weaknesschanges to your mental state (trouble focusing, confusion, personality changes) or dementia (problems with memory, thinking, and/or decision-making)Ocular syphilis is when syphilis spreads to your eyes. Its symptoms include:eye painrednesschanges in your visionblindnessOtosyphilis is when syphilis spreads to and affects your hearing. Its symptoms include:hearing lossringing in your ears (tinnitus)dizzinessvertigoIf you do notice symptoms like this, or you’ve had unprotected sex and may have been exposed to an STI, it’s vital to get tested as soon as possible. If left untreated, syphilis can lead to potentially life-threatening health issues.",

    "question": "Who should get tested for syphilis?",
    "answer": "If you think you’ve been exposed to syphilis or have any symptoms of syphilis, you should consider getting tested as quickly as possible. You should also consider getting tested if:you’ve recently had unprotected sex with a new partnerhave sex with multiple partnersare sexually activehave another sexually transmitted disease (e.g. chlamydia, gonorrhoea)Risk groupsCertain groups of people are considered more at risk of contracting syphilis or can have an additional risk of complications if they develop a severe syphilis infection. If you are in one of these groups, you should consider getting tested regularly and make sure you practice safe sex. These risk groups include:people who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant – in 2023, 41.3% of pregnancies with syphilis required treatmentpeople who inject drugs with a needle or share needlespeople who have multiple sex partnerspeople who are gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) – in 2018, 75% of new syphilis diagnoses in England were among this grouppeople who have an HIV infection and are sexually activepeople who are in racial/ethnic and sexual minority groupsWhy should I get tested for syphilis?You should get tested for syphilis because:1. You can spread it easilySyphilis can be asymptomatic (not cause symptoms), and it can be tough to tell if you have an infection or not. This makes it easy to spread syphilis without realising it, especially if you’re having sex with multiple partners.2. It can worsen if left untreatedWhen left untreated, it can lead to severe health issues. It’s also important to remember that while the symptoms of syphilis can die down or even go away completely, the infection will remain in your body until you get treatment. “Testing for syphilis is the only way to know for certain you have the condition. It’s vital to get tested if you’ve been exposed to get answers and treatment. With treatment, syphilis can be dealt with quickly and effectively.” – Dr Brenda Ikeji, Medical Editor",

    "answer": "This test is a blood sample test, so you need to collect a small amount of blood for analysis.You will receive full instructions explaining precisely how to do this with your test. You will do this using a lancet, which you will use to prick your finger, causing it to bleed slightly. From here, you collect your sample and return it to our lab.Taking your at-home testWash your hands thoroughly using warm, soapy water. Choose a finger from which you want to collect blood (we recommend using a finger from your non-dominant hand, in case your finger hurts afterwards).Open the collection tube and place it nearby for when you collect your sample.Sanitise your chosen finger by wiping it with the provided alcohol swab.Take out the lancet, and twist and pull the purple stick. This test kit comes with multiple lancets, so you can attempt the test again if you make a mistake or it doesn’t work.Place the end of the lancet against your fingertip and press the purple button. You will feel a sharp scratch on your finger. Afterwards, you should notice a small droplet of blood if you’ve done this correctly. If not, you can try again with a spare lancet.Wipe away the first drop of blood using a tissue.Aim your finger downwards over the collection tube and squeeze it gently to allow blood to fall into the tube.Continue to fill the tube until it reaches the line shown. If you can not produce enough blood to fill the tube to the line, you can use a spare lancet to prick your finger to try again and continue.Seal the collection tube securely and fill out the label to attach to your sample.Place the tube inside the provided wallet before placing it in the prepaid envelope.Your sample is now ready to be posted to the lab for analysis.Remember to follow the instructions included with your test kit to get the most accurate results.

For best accuracy, wait at least 1 hour before urinating for your test. Use the small bottle to collect your sample of urine, filling the bottle up at least halfway. Secure the lid of the small bottle tight and place it into the larger bottle. Add the label complete with your details onto the sample bottle.Send your test kit back to be processed with the box provided with your kit, following the instructions to deliver it to the lab for testing. You should try to collect urine that comes out first – if you have chlamydia it contains the most amount of bacteria and will give a more accurate result. How to use a vaginal swab chlamydia test If you are using the vaginal swab test to provide your sample, you should: Wash your hands, open up your test kit box and follow the instructions. Break the seal of the swab (without touching the tip of the swab). Use one hand to spread the skin outside your vagina, and the other hand to locate the swab towards your vaginal opening. Insert the tip of the swab in the vagina but do not insert it too deeply, follow the instructions provided with your test kit as to how far to place the swab. Rotate the swab inside the vagina for 10 to 15 seconds. Take it out without touching other parts of your skin. Place the swab inside the tube provided and secure it. Attach the label with your details on it, so the lab knows who it belongs to and so you can get your results.

    "question": "What is chlamydia?",
    "answer": "Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the UK and is caused by the bacteria chlamydia trachomatis. Chlamydia is passed on from person to person through unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex. It can also be spread by: sharing unwashed, uncovered sex toyscoming into contact with infected vaginal fluid or semen (such as it getting in your eye)genital-on-genital contact (even if there is no penetration, orgasm or ejaculation) Chlamydia is often symptomless, but signs you might have chlamydia include: unusual vaginal, penile or anal discharge pain when peeing pain and swelling in the testicles pain in stomach, bleeding after sex and between periods It is important to get tested for chlamydia, as if it is left untreated there can be complications, such as: Pregnancy complications If you have untreated chlamydia during pregnancy, there is a likelihood that it could be passed on to your baby. Your baby might develop infections if exposed to chlamydia, or they may be at risk of a low birthweight or premature birth. You should contact your doctor, nurse or midwife if you are pregnant and think you have been exposed to chlamydia. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Chlamydia can spread to the womb, ovaries or fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease. This can cause infertility, chronic pain in the pelvis, and an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. The symptoms of PID are similar to symptoms of chlamydia, including pain during sex and urination, or bleeding in between periods and after sex. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms and you are unsure if they are chlamydia or PID, speak with your doctor. Inflammation of the testicles Chlamydia can spread to the testicles and tubes that carry sperm from them (epididymis). This can cause swollen and painful testicles. Reactive arthritis (SARA)Chlamydia can cause reactive arthritis, which is where your joints, eyes or urethra (the tube that passes urine out of the body) become inflamed. This typically happens within the first few weeks of having chlamydia. There is currently no cure for SARA, but it often gets better within a few months and is usually treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen. Due to how common chlamydia is, how it is often symptomless and the potential complications of the infection, it is important to test regularly. With our chlamydia home test kit, you can do this from the comfort of your own home, and get results fast so you can treat it on time.",

    "question": "Who should get tested for anal chlamydia and gonorrhoea?",
    "answer": "You should get tested for anal chlamydia and gonorrhoea if: you believe you might have caught the infection, such as if you’re getting symptoms or a partner has told you they’ve got the infectionyou’ve had unprotected anal sex with a new or casual partnerChlamydia and gonorrhoea are particularly common in people under the age of 25, so it’s recommended to get tested for them at least once a year. As you can catch it in the throat, genitals, and anus, you may need to do separate tests depending on whether you engage in oral, vaginal, or anal sex. You may be at a higher risk of catching anal chlamydia and gonorrhoea if you:have another STI, such as HIVhave had chlamydia or gonorrhoea beforeare a man who has sex with men (MSM)In studies, anal chlamydia was found to be the most common type of chlamydia in MSM, as opposed to chlamydia of the genitals or throat. Why should I get tested for anal chlamydia and gonorrhoea?Anal chlamydia and gonorrhoea often have no symptoms, so testing is usually the only way to make sure you do not have the infection. They’re also very common, so should be routinely tested for if you’re having unprotected sex. Leaving anal chlamydia or gonorrhoea untreated increases the risk of:passing it on to other sexual partners and further spreading the infectionlong-term health problemscatching another STI HIV transmission, especially in MSM",

    "question": "When should I get tested for anal chlamydia and gonorrhoea?",
    "answer": "If you’re taking an anal chlamydia and gonorrhoea test, you’ll need to wait 2 weeks from the last time you had anal sex, including oral-anal sex. You can take a test straight away if you have symptoms of either infection (anal discharge, pain or itching), even if it’s not been 2 weeks.Chlamydia and gonorrhoea have an incubation period, which is how long it takes the bacteria to multiply enough that the infection will show up on a swab test. Gonorrhoea can be tested for 1 week after sex, while chlamydia needs 2 weeks. When testing for both infections together, waiting 2 weeks will mean your results are much more likely to be accurate. If you have taken the test too early, you might need to repeat it after 2 weeks to make sure you are not infected.",

If you need to pass a stool, it’s best to do this first and wait a little while to make sure your anal passage is clean. Using the test kit:Wash and dry your hands before starting the test. Unpack the kit. Read the instructions carefully, and get everything ready.Get in a comfortable position so that you will be able to insert the swab into your anus. This could be bending over or sitting on a toilet. Twist the cap to break the seal of the swab test, being careful to not let the tip touch anything.Point the swab toward your anus and slowly guide it in. It does not need to go deep – around 2 or 3 cm is enough to collect the sample. Rotate the swab for around 10 to 15 seconds (or 5 to 10 times) around the inside walls of your anus. Continue rotating the swab as you gently remove it.Place the swab in the tube provided, snapping it at the break line and sealing it securely.Wash your hands before putting the label with your details on the tube. Don’t forget the label or the lab will not know who the sample belongs to when they receive it. Place and seal it in the prepaid envelope. Your sample can now be posted in any UK post box.

    "question": "What do my results mean?",
    "answer": "Once our doctors have reviewed your results, they will let you know what they mean, and what to do next. What does a negative anal chlamydia and gonorrhoea test result mean?A negative result means at the time of testing, there was no presence of the infection found in your anus. You do not need to do anything else and will not need a follow-up test, although it’s important to test again if you have unprotected anal sex or you develop symptoms. What does a positive anal chlamydia and gonorrhoea test result mean?A positive result means that you have one or both infections in your anus. Gonorrhoea treatment typically involves an antibiotic injection, so you’ll need to speak with your GP or a sexual health clinic and book an appointment. As you’ve already had a test, you just need to let them know you’ve tested positive. They may ask for a copy of your results. Chlamydia treatment is an oral antibiotic called doxycycline. You can get it online from ZAVA, and one of our doctors can prescribe it for you if you’ve tested positive. You can also get treatment for chlamydia from NHS services. Avoid having sexual contact with anyone until you’ve finished your treatment course. You’ll also need to let any sexual partners you’ve had in the last 6 months know you’ve tested positive for anal chlamydia or /gonorrhoea. If you’re worried about this, you can usually speak to a sexual health clinic about sending an anonymous text message for you. Around 6 weeks after treatment, you’ll usually be invited for a follow-up test to make sure the infection has gone.",

    "answer": "Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection or (STI). It’s caused by bacteria, which can be treated with antibiotics. It usually does not cause any symptoms, which is possibly one reason why it is the most common STI in the UK. Chlamydia symptomsMost people don’t get symptoms. If you do get chlamydia symptoms, this may include:unusual discharge from the anus or genitals pain when peeing bleeding between periods and after sex (in women)pain in the stomach (in women)testicle swelling and pain (in men)In one study among men who have sex with men (MSM), 85% of anal chlamydia infections caused no symptoms. If you do get anal chlamydia symptoms, this may include:anal painanal dischargeanal bleedingan urgent or frequent feeling that you need to pass stools, even if you cannot How is chlamydia spread?Chlamydia is spread through unprotected sex or contact with genital fluids in the anus, throat, genitals, and less commonly, the eyes. In particular, anal chlamydia may be spread by:unprotected anal sex, even without full penetration or ejaculationunprotected oral sex with someone who has chlamydia of the throatsharing sex toys that have not been washed or covered with a condom between partnersDoctors still aren’t sure if chlamydia can be spread on fingers if they come into contact with the infection. Chlamydia cannot be spread through sharing towels, baths, toilet seats, or by kissing or hugging.The risks of leaving chlamydia untreatedNo matter where you have a chlamydia infection, leaving it untreated can cause the bacteria to spread to other parts of your body, causing possible long-term health problems.MenUntreated chlamydia can cause epididymitis, an inflammation or infection in a part of your testicles called the epididymis. This is rare but left untreated may affect your fertility. Men are also more at risk of a condition called sexually acquired reactive arthritis (SARA). This causes inflammation in the joints, urethra, or eyes. It’s most likely to happen in the first few weeks of catching the infection. WomenUntreated chlamydia can spread to the female reproductive organs, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Like chlamydia, this is often symptomless, but it can lead to more health issues, including:ectopic pregnancy (a medical emergency in which the egg implants itself outside of your womb)difficulty getting pregnant, or in some cases, infertilitypelvic pain that does not go awayWomen can also get sexually acquired reactive arthritis. Pregnant womenIf you give birth and are infected with chlamydia, there’s a chance it can be passed to your child. This may cause an eye or lung infection that needs treating straight away. Having chlamydia during pregnancy also increases the risk of:premature labourthe baby being born with a low birth weight",

This is because the bacteria cannot live outside the body for long. The risks of leaving gonorrhoea untreatedIf you have gonorrhoea and do not get treatment, the bacteria can spread to other parts of your body, causing further complications. The more you have gonorrhoea, the higher the risk of complications. In rare cases, the bacteria gets into the bloodstream, causing a life-threatening infection called sepsis. Men Untreated gonorrhoea can cause:infertility (in rare cases)a painful infection in a part of the male reproductive system, such as the prostate gland, testicles, or the Mullerian or Cowper glandsurethral stricture, which is a build-up of scar tissue that causes a narrow urethra, making it harder to peeWomenIf gonorrhoea spreads to the female reproductive system, it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease in around 10 to 20% of women. PID can also cause:chronic pelvic paininfertilityectopic pregnancyPregnant womenPregnant women with untreated gonorrhoea are at risk of:miscarriagepremature labourpassing the infection onto the baby during birth, causing an eye infection called conjunctivitis If you find out you have gonorrhoea, you must tell your midwife straight away.

Both infections can cause complications if left untreated, including infertility.You can pass the infection on to new and casual partners, further spreading the infection. Testing regularly can reduce the number of cases so fewer people are affected.

    "question": "What is chlamydia?",
    "answer": "The STI chlamydia is the most common in the UK. It’s often symptomless, so people may not know they have it without getting tested regularly. It’s caused by bacteria and is spread through unprotected sex, or contact with infected genital fluids. 50% of men and at least 70% of women do not get any obvious symptoms. If you do, they include:pain when peeing (urinating)unusual discharge from the genitals or anus bleeding after sex or between periods, and pain in the stomach in womenpain and swelling in the testicles in menHow is chlamydia spread?Chlamydia can be spread through:unprotected sex in the vagina, anus, or mouthgetting infected genital fluid into your eyesharing sex toys that are not covered and washed between usersgenital contact – so you can still get it without penetration, ejaculation, or orgasmIf you’re pregnant and get chlamydia in the vagina, your baby can catch it during birth. Chlamydia isn’t spread through contact like kissing or hugging, or by sharing towels, baths, or toilet seats. What are the risks of leaving chlamydia untreated?The fact that chlamydia does not always cause symptoms can be dangerous, especially without regular testing. When left untreated chlamydia can cause some serious health issues. Leaving chlamydia untreated in women means it can spread to the ovaries, womb, or fallopian tubes and cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This can then cause further health issues, such as:infertility or difficulty getting pregnant (the chance of this is lowered if treated early)an increased risk of having an ectopic pregnancy, where the egg implants itself outside of the womb (this is a medical emergency)chronic pelvic painIf you give birth and have chlamydia, there’s a chance it can be passed onto your baby and cause an infection in the eye or lungs. Having chlamydia in pregnancy can also increase the chance of premature labour, or your baby having a low birthweight. Leaving chlamydia untreated in men can cause epididymitis, which is inflammation of the epididymis (a tube behind the testicles). This can be painful but is very rare. If you get testicular swelling and pain, speak to a doctor straight away as leaving epididymitis untreated could affect your fertility. Both men and women are also at risk of getting sexually acquired reactive arthritis. It’s most likely within the first few weeks of getting chlamydia and causes inflammation in your joints, eyes, or urethra. This is more common in men and there is no cure, although most people get better within a few months.Fortunately, the bacteria that causes chlamydia is easily killed off with a course of antibiotics.",

Gonorrhoea symptoms in women include:unusual discharge from the vagina, such as green, yellow, watery, or thinpain or tenderness in the stomachburning or pain when urinatingchanges in the way you bleed, such as heavier periods, or bleeding after sex and between periodsGonorrhoea symptoms in men include:unusual discharge from the penis, such as green, yellow, or white dischargeburning or pain when urinatingforeskin swellingtesticular pain or tenderness, although this is rareHow is gonorrhoea spread?Gonorrhoea can easily be spread through:unprotected sex in the vagina, anus, or mouthsharing sex toys that are not covered and washed between userscontact with genital fluid in the urethra, anus, throat, or eyesNew evidence also suggests that gonorrhoea of the throat could be passed on through kissing if one person already has the infection. If you’re pregnant and get gonorrhoea in the vagina or cervix, your baby can catch it during birth. Gonorrhoea isn’t spread through contact like hugging, or by sharing towels, baths, or toilet seats. The bacteria that causes the infection cannot live outside the body for long. What are the risks of leaving gonorrhoea untreated?Leaving gonorrhoea untreated can lead to complications and long-term health problems. The more times you catch it, the more likely you are to have complications.In rare cases, gonorrhoea can spread into the bloodstream and cause a life-threatening infection called sepsis. This is a medical emergency and needs to be treated straight away. Gonorrhoea complications in women and babiesIn around 10% to 20% of untreated gonorrhoea cases, it spreads to the female reproductive organs causing pelvic inflammatory disease. This then causes further problems, like:long-term pelvic painectopic pregnancyinfertilityDuring pregnancy, untreated gonorrhoea may cause:premature labourmiscarriagethe baby to get an eye infection called conjunctivitisIf your baby is not treated straight away with antibiotics, there’s a risk of permanent blindness. Gonorrhoea complications in menUntreated gonorrhoea in men can cause:a painful infection in the prostate gland (prostatitis), epididymis or the tube behind the testicles (epididymitis), or the Mullerian or Cowper glands infertilityurethral stricture (scar tissues that cause the urethra to narrow, causing a blockage and making it harder to urinate)Catching gonorrhoea early is unlikely to lead to complications. It can be treated with an antibiotic injection given by a doctor or nurse at a GP surgery, sexual health clinic, and some other NHS services.",

    "answer": "A home HIV test is an effective way to check if you have HIV from the comfort of your home. You collect a small sample of blood from your finger and send it back to our laboratory for testing. Our team will then contact you through your ZAVA private patient account with your results. The home HIV testing kit works by detecting both the p24 antigen (a protein that’s found on the HIV virus) and anti-HIV antibodies (made by your body to fight off HIV infection). p24 is usually found in the early stages of HIV infection, and antibodies are made later on. By testing for both, this test can pick up HIV over a longer period. It also tests for the 2 main strains of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2.",

    "question": "What is HIV?",
    "answer": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a viral infection that’s spread via infected fluid, such as:bloodsemenvaginal fluidanal fluidbreastmilk Fluids like sweat, urine, and saliva do not contain enough of the virus for it to spread.To become infected, HIV must enter the bloodstream. It can be transferred: via injection into the blood by sharing needles or other injection equipmentthrough cuts or wounds on the skinthrough the thin skin around the genitals, including inside the vagina and anusthrough the thin lining of the eyes and mouthMost people get HIV from having condomless vaginal or anal sex with someone who has HIV, but it’s also possible to get HIV from other sexual activities, like unprotected oral sex or sharing sex toys. After entering the body, HIV replicates itself and gradually damages the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off other types of infection. The late stage of infection, where your immune system is badly damaged, is known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Why should I get tested for HIV?Getting early treatment for HIV can help prevent the virus from replicating and avoid long-term damage to the immune system. However, many people with HIV do not realise they have it, which means regular testing is essential. In the first few weeks after getting HIV, most people experience a flu-like illness with symptoms such as:a high temperaturesore throatrashjoint and muscle paintirednessenlarged glandsBut these signs can easily be mistaken for the flu or another illness. Once they improve, there may not be any other symptoms for several years, which is why testing is so important.",

    "question": "When should I get tested for HIV?",
    "answer": "Getting emergency treatment before testingIf you think there’s a high chance you’ve been exposed to HIV, it’s important to seek medical help as soon as you can because you may need to take emergency HIV medication. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a medication that can reduce the risk of getting HIV if started up to 72 hours after potential exposure. These medications are similar to those taken after a HIV diagnosis, but they’re usually taken for around 28 days. A healthcare professional can advise you if you should take PEP.When to testFor our home HIV test kit, we advise waiting at least 45 days after you think you may have been infected with HIV. If you take a test earlier than this, negative results may be false. In some cases, you may need to be retested 1 to 3 months later to confirm a negative result. Some blood tests for HIV can give reliable results from 1 month after infection, but other tests may not be accurate until a longer time after infection. This is because the virus levels (and the body’s response to the virus) need to be high enough to be detected by the test.People who want to rule out having HIV can get tested by visiting their local sexual health clinic or by ordering a home testing kit.",

    "question": "How to use a HIV test at home",
    "answer": "You will need to provide a small blood sample at home using a small finger-prick device called a lancet. You might feel nervous about this, but the process is straightforward and simple. Once you have collected your sample, post it back to our partner laboratory using the prepaid postage label to receive your results within 72 hours of them receiving it.What’s inside the kitEach test kit contains 3 lancets. You only need 1 for the test, but an extra 2 are provided in case you need them. You’ll also have some swabs, a plaster, and a collection tube for the blood sample in your kit. We’ll give you all the materials needed to send your sample to the lab, including a prepaid envelope.If you make a mistake, we can send you another test kit free of charge.Taking the testYou can take the sample at any time of the day. Make sure it has been at least 45 days since you think you were infected.To collect your sample, you’ll need to:Wash your hands with warm, soapy water and dry them before using the test.Wipe an alcohol swab on the finger you want to collect the sample from and wait for the skin to dry.Take a lancet from the kit and twist and remove the purple stick. Place the lancet onto your fingertip and press down on the button at the end.You should see a small drop of blood on your fingertip when you squeeze it. If you do not, try again on another finger with a new lancet. Wipe away the first drop of blood with a tissue.Open the collection tube, put your finger downwards towards the tube and squeeze your fingertip, allowing the blood to drop into the tube until you fill it to the top line. If you cannot get enough blood from one finger, use another lancet on another finger.Once the tube is filled, apply the plaster to your fingertip and screw the lid back on the tube securely. Write your details on the label provided and stick it to the collection tube.Place the tube inside the wallet and the wallet inside the prepaid envelope. You can then post this sample at your nearest postbox.Make sure to post your sample the same day you collect it and avoid sending it over a weekend or bank holiday.For detailed instructions, please see the leaflet, which comes with your test kit.",

Regardless of your test results, our team is always there for advice and support.What does a negative HIV test result mean?As long as you took the test at least 45 days after you may have been exposed to HIV, a negative result means you are not currently infected with HIV.You do not need to take another test unless you are potentially exposed to HIV again.What does a positive HIV test result mean?If you receive a positive test result for HIV, it means the HIV infection was detected in the sample you provided. Our doctors will advise you on what to do next. You will need to do another follow-up test in a clinic, and if this returns as positive, it means you have HIV. You’ll need to seek medical care, but we’ll help you find specialist services that will test and treat you.HIV can be managed by taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). This is a combination of medications used to slow down the progression of the virus. By taking your medication every day and attending appointments, you can avoid HIV progressing to AIDS. And, the sooner you start treatment, the less likely you are to become seriously unwell. Many people who get an early diagnosis and take their medication go on to live healthy and full lives.",

They are:syphilishuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)hepatitis B and CThese infections can be spread through sexual contact or by sharing needles. This at-home test kit enables you to collect a sample at home using the equipment provided and post it back to our partner lab.SyphilisSyphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can have serious long-term consequences if left untreated. It’s caused by the bacterium known as Treponema pallidum, and is passed on through oral, vaginal, and anal sex. Many people who get syphilis do not have any symptoms, so it can go unnoticed for years. Syphilis symptoms can also change over time and it may take 3 weeks or more for symptoms to show, if they do. They include:small ulcers on your penis, vagina, or around your bottom – they are often painless and you may only have 1sores in other places on the body such as lips, hands, or in your mouthwart-like growths on your penis, vagina, or bottoma rash on the palm of your hands or soles of your feetwhite patches in your mouthflu-like symptomsswollen glandspatchy hair lossHow is syphilis spread?Syphilis is spread by:unprotected vaginal, oral, or anal sexcoming into contact with an ulcer on a sexual partner's penis, vagina, anus, or in their mouthpregnancy to an unborn babyinjecting drugs with a needle used by someone who has syphilisa blood transfusion or organ transplant – this is rare and all blood and organs are checked for syphilis in the UKWhat are the risks of leaving syphilis untreated?If syphilis is not treated it can cause serious health issues and can be life-threatening. For example, the infection can cause:heart issues – angina, aortic aneurysm, and heart failurebrain issues – seizures, memory problems, personality changes, and dementianerve issues – pins and needles, joint pain, shooting pains, and joint damageskin and organ problemsHowever, if detected early, syphilis can be treated with a course of antibiotics. How long you will need to be treated for will depend on the stage of the infection. HIVHIV is a virus that attacks the immune system and causes a wide range of conditions that may lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The virus weakens the body’s immune system so it struggles to fight everyday, common infections and diseases.Usually, people who become infected with HIV experience flu-like symptoms for 1 or 2 weeks. These present within 2 to 6 weeks after being infected. Once these HIV symptoms have disappeared, it may not cause any more symptoms for years, but it will still damage your immune system. Some people get an HIV rash which is an early sign of infection. How is HIV spread?HIV is present in bodily fluids, including: semen, vaginal and anal fluidsbreast milkblood It cannot be spread by urine, sweat, or saliva. The most common way to get HIV in the UK is through having unprotected vaginal or anal sex, but it can also be spread by:sharing needles, syringes, or injections with an infected personpregnancy, breastfeeding, or birthIf you are at an increased risk of HIV exposure, you can take pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to protect yourself. What are the risks if HIV is left untreated?If HIV isn’t treated, it can cause damage to the immune system and lead to conditions that may be life-limiting or threatening, such as:AIDSdementialiver diseasetuberculosis (TB)cancer “If you believe you may have come into contact with HIV, emergency medicine called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can be given, ideally within 24 hours, to stop you becoming infected. An early HIV diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, improving your chances of controlling the virus and limiting its impact on your body. The only way to find out if you have been infected is to have an HIV test.” — Dr Brenda Ikeji - Medical Editor Hepatitis BHepatitis is caused by a virus that infects the blood and can develop slowly, over a number of years without any symptoms, so you may not know you have been infected. Hepatitis B causes liver inflammation and if left untreated can cause liver damage.How is hepatitis B spread?Hepatitis B is spread when the blood or bodily fluid of an infected person enters your bloodstream, like during unprotected sex or sharing needles.What are the risks if hepatitis B is left untreated?If hepatitis B is not treated, it can remain in the body for a long time and lead to liver problems, including:cirrhosis (scarring)cancerdeathA vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis B and is given to high-risk people, such as:healthcare workersinjectable drug usersmen who have sex with menchildren whose mother has hepatitis Bpeople travelling to areas of the world where hepatitis B is prevalentall children in the UK as part of their routine immunisation programmeHepatitis CHepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus and often has no noticeable symptoms. Some people may experience flu-like symptoms.How is hepatitis C spread?Hepatitis C is spread through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person, such as:during unprotected sexsharing needles, syringes, and injectionsWhat are the risks if hepatitis C is left untreated? Some people will fight off the hepatitis C infection on their own. In others, it can remain in the body for many years, leading to liver cirrhosis or liver failure.

It’s completely normal to be concerned – STIs are very common, and hundreds of thousands of people are diagnosed with them in the UK every year.The sooner you get treatment, the lower the risk of spreading the infection or of any complications. You can get fast results and fast-track your treatment by taking a test, either at home with a test kit or by visiting a sexual health clinic. Our female STI test can quickly give you an answer if you’re concerned you have an infection or you have symptoms. If the results come back positive (meaning you have caught a specific STI), you can then begin a treatment plan as soon as possible. “If you’re worried you might have caught an infection, a female STI test can help give you peace of mind. They’re quick, easy, and painless, and can allow you to get one step closer to treatment if you do have an STI. It can be reassuring to know that whatever result you get, getting diagnosed and treated as soon as possible is always best for your overall health” – Dr Zoe Miller, Medical Editor.",

    "question": "Reasons why you might want to get tested",
    "answer": "There are a few other reasons you might wish to order a female STI test kit:1. Unprotected sexIf you’ve recently had unprotected sex with someone whose STI status you’re not certain about, it’s a good idea to get tested. Many people have STIs without symptoms, such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea, and you cannot always tell if someone has an infection just by looking. 2. You have symptomsYou may have noticed possible symptoms of STIs, such as unusual vaginal discharge, pain when urinating, or sores around your genitals. Getting an STI test for women can help get to the bottom of these symptoms. 3. You have a new partnerIf you have begun a new sexual relationship, you and your partner may both wish to do an STI test. This can be a good way of building trust. It’s also recommended by BASHH to test at the start of a relationship if you have 1 long-term mutually exclusive partner. If your partner is a man, then a negative result on both of your STI tests might mean you can start having sex without a condom (while using other contraceptives if you want to prevent pregnancy). 4. You’re planning to start a familyDoing an STI test for women might be something to consider if you’re planning to start a family. Some infections can pass to your future baby, so it’s best to get anything treated first. Untreated STIs can also impact your fertility long term, especially if left untreated for a long time. For example, untreated STIs like chlamydia and gonorrhoea can cause:pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), an infection that affects the female reproductive organs, causing scarring of the fallopian tubesinfertilityectopic pregnancy (where the egg implants itself outside of the womb, usually in the fallopian tubes)",

    "question": "What can our female STI test kits detect?",
    "answer": "At ZAVA, we provide 2 kinds of female STI testing kits: a ‘basic’ screen and a ‘full’ screen. Both test kits can detect a range of different organisms that cause certain STIs.1. Basic female STI testOur ‘basic’ STI screen will test you for:gonorrhoea (vaginal, anal, and oral) – please note that not everyone has to be tested in all these places, but you can take a sample if you’re concerned about your riskchlamydia (vaginal, anal, and oral)HIVsyphilisGonorrhoeaGonorrhoea is caused by bacteria called Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It can cause abnormal vaginal discharge and bleeding in between periods, amongst other symptoms, however most women do not show any symptoms at all. There has been an increase in the number of people being diagnosed with gonorrhoea in the UK in recent years.Chlamydia Chlaymdia is one of the most common STIs in the UK. It’s caused by the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis, and can cause pain when urinating, bleeding between periods, or unusual vaginal discharge. You may also get no symptoms when you have chlamydia.HIV HIV is an infection caused by the human immunodeficiency virus and usually causes flu-like symptoms when the virus first enters your system before resting dormant for up to 10 years. HIV damages your immune system and gradually weakens your ability to fight off infection over time. If you are infected with HIV and it’s left untreated, it can progress into a serious illness called AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). There are effective HIV treatments that help stop the virus from replicating and damaging your immune system. By starting treatment early, you can stop HIV from progressing to AIDS and live a full and healthy life.SyphilisSyphilis is caused by bacteria called Treponema pallidum and can be treated with a course of antibiotics. A common symptom of syphilis in women is the appearance of small sores on your vagina. 2. Full female STI testOur ‘full’ STI test kit for women will screen you for:HIVhepatitis Bhepatitis CsyphilischlamydiagonorrhoeaMycoplasma genitaliumureaplasma DNAtrichomoniasisbacterial vaginosisherpes simplex I & II➤ All of the STIs treated by our full test kit have different symptoms. Get a broader overview in our guide to women’s STI symptoms. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) can be triggered by having sex and new research shows it can be sexually transmitted. BV can make you more likely to get an STI as the infection changes the environment of your vagina.",

    "question": "How to use your female STI test",
    "answer": "If you’ve never used a female STI testing kit before, it can feel a bit unusual collecting swabs, blood, and urine samples for the first time. But don’t worry, they’re easy to use, and you can simply follow the step-by-step instructions included. Depending on whether you get the ‘basic’ or ‘full’ women’s STI test kit, you’ll need to provide different samples. After you’ve taken the samples, put them in the protective packaging that’s supplied with the test kit. Then, as soon as possible after taking your samples, you should send it to the lab in the prepaid envelope (also supplied in your test kit). You can post all your samples in one go and should send them all in the same envelope that comes with your kit. Once the lab has received your samples, you’ll get your results online, through your confidential ZAVA account within 2 to 3 working days. We recommend finding out your local Post Office collection times so you can do your test on the same day it will be sent out. For a complete analysis, we may ask you to share a:small blood sampleurine samplethroat swabgenital swabThe female STI test kit comes with several swabs and a finger prick test for you to collect the samples. If you accidentally make any mistakes, there are spares included in the package. Find out how to use each swab or test in your kit by thoroughly reading the instructions included in your test kit, or checking the relevant section below. Make sure you wash your hands before doing your test.Vaginal swabInsert the swab into your vagina, up to about 5cm deep. Gently rotate the swab with your fingers while brushing it against the walls of the vagina for 5 seconds. Once finished, take the swab out and place it inside the tube so the cotton end is at the bottom of the tube, then snap the stick at the black line and put the lid on tight. Place your test tube in the transport pouch provided. Oral swabOpen your mouth wide and brush the swab against the back and sides of your throat for 30 seconds. Once finished, put the swab inside the tube and snap the stick at the black line. Place the tube lid on and tighten before putting it in the transport pouch provided. Rectal swabPlease note: the rectal swab is optional and only needs to be carried out if you’re at risk of a sexually trasnmitted infection in your anus, or you’re concerned and would like to make sure. Insert the swab about 2 to 3cm into your anus and rotate it gently with your fingers around 5 to 10 times. Take the swab out and place it inside the tube provided with your test kit, snap the swab at the black line and tighten the lid on the tube. Place your tube inside the transport pouch provided. Finger prick testWash your hands in warm, soapy water. It’s easier to collect blood when your hands are warm and we recommend taking blood from the middle or ring finger. Use the alcohol swab provided to clean the area you will be using. Twist and remove the blue stick from the lancet.Position it against the side of your chosen finger and then press it firmly against the skin until you hear a click. Once your skin is punctured, you should see a small drop of blood. Wipe this first drop away. Then, hold your hand downwards and massage your hand down to your finger to encourage blood flow into the tube, filling the tube up to the upper line. If you cannot collect enough blood, repeat this process again with another lancet on a different part of your finger (spare lancets are provided in the kit). Once blood is collected, screw the tube on and tighten to secure it. Label your tube, and place it inside the clear case provided.For more detailed information on getting blood from your finger during this process, read the instruction guide included with your test kit.",

    "question": "When to take an STI test",
    "answer": "If you’ve had unprotected sex, you may want to know as soon as possible whether you have caught an infection. However, you should wait for a few days or weeks before you can test for an STI. Certain STIs will not be detected by a screening kit if you test too early. This can give you a false negative result and delay your treatment if you have an STI. After taking a test, you need to send all your samples in one go for the lab to complete the screening. If you’re unsure about whether it’s the right time to get tested, speak to your doctor or sexual health clinic. Please note that an at-home test kit should not be done on a Sunday or bank holiday, as the sample will take longer to arrive and it should be posted as soon as the samples are collected. Here is the guide for the best time to get a test for STI after unprotected sex:",

    "question": "Understanding your test results",
    "answer": "Getting a positive resultIf you test positive for any of the STIs listed in this screening kit, it means you have an STI. Getting a positive result can be daunting, however, it’s important to know that all STIs can be treated with medications. Some can be completely cured, such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea, while others can be treated for the long term but will still dormant in your body and may cause outbreaks (such as genital herpes). As there are many treatment options available for preventing and managing outbreaks, you should be able to continue to live a perfectly normal life. What to do nextOur doctors can help and support you with what to do next, including providing information on where to get treatment. After getting a positive result, there are a few steps you need to take next. This will depend on what STI you have tested positive for.For certain STIs, you’ll need to take a short course of antibiotics or antiviral medication. Some of these are offered through ZAVA, including treatments for chlamydia, genital herpes, and trichomoniasis.If you test positive for HIV, you’ll need to do another test to confirm that you have HIV. If this comes back positive (meaning that you have HIV), we can advise you on specialist treatment centres to contact so that you can get started on treatment as soon as possible. Alternatively, you can choose to speak to your doctor about your test results.If you have a positive STI test result, we strongly advise you to tell any recent sexual partners you’ve had, so they can get tested too. This can, of course, feel a little awkward. But it’s better for them to know sooner rather than later for their health. You should be able to do this anonymously at your local sexual health clinic via text or we can provide this service for you. Getting a negative resultIf your test comes back negative, this means you do not have any of the STIs you tested for. There’s also a chance that you have not waiting long enough to take a test (if you tested earlier than recommended for the STIs you were testing for).What to do nextIf your result is negative and you’re sure you tested at the right time, you do not need to do anything, unless you get symptoms or have unprotected sex again. If you have certain symptoms that you thought might be an STI, a negative result can be confusing. There are other conditions where the symptoms might appear similar to those of an STI, such as bacterial vaginosis so it’s best to speak with your doctor to get further tests done. Sometimes, we cannot give you a definitive result for your STI test. If the swabs were not used correctly or there was cross-contamination somewhere, it may not be possible to give you a result. If you have any concerns, you should raise this via your patient account.",

Genital chlamydia doesn’t always cause symptoms, 70% of women and 50% of men do not experience any signs and are unaware they may be infected. However, if you get chlamydia symptoms, they can present differently if you have a penis or a vagina.Genital chlamydia symptoms in women include:pain when going for a peeunusual vaginal dischargetummy pain, bleeding after sex, and bleeding between periodsGenital chlamydia symptoms in men include:pain when going for a peeunusual discharge from the penistesticular painChlamydia can be spread through unprotected sex or coming into contact with genital fluids, but it cannot be passed on by sharing towels, baths, toilet seats, or by kissing or hugging. What happens if chlamydia is left untreated?Leaving genital chlamydia untreated can lead to long-term health problems as the infection can spread to other parts of the body.In men, untreated genital chlamydia can:spread to the testicles and the tubes that carry sperm called the epididymis, causing pain and swelling (epididymitis)in rare cases, lead to infertility In women, if chlamydia is left untreated, it can lead to: pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)ectopic pregnancyinfertilityThat’s why it is important to get tested and receive treatment as soon as possible.Genital gonorrhoeaEasily passed through unprotected sex or coming into contact with sexual fluids, genital gonorrhoea is an STI caused by bacteria. Most men (90%) and half of women (50%) get no symptoms.If you do get them, gonorrhoea symptoms include:thick green or yellow discharge from the vagina or penis pain when going for a peebleeding between periods in womenWhat happens if genital gonorrhoea is left untreated?It is important to get tested for gonorrhoea as soon as possible because it can lead to long-term health complications, such as PID in women, or infertility in both men and women.HerpesGenital herpes is another common STI in the UK and can be passed on through vaginal, anal, or oral sex. The symptoms include:small blisters that burst, leaving open, red sores around your genitals, anus, thighs, or bottomtingling or burning sensations around your genitalspain when going for a peeunusual genital dischargeWhat happens if genital herpes is not treated?There is no cure for genital herpes and the symptoms will clear up by themselves but the sores can come back. This is known as an outbreak or recurrence. You can pass genital herpes on even if you do not have visible sores or other symptoms.Treatments for genital herpes can help to relieve some of the symptoms and stop them getting worse, or shorten recurrent outbreaks.MycoplasmaMycoplasma genitalium is a bacteria that is spread through sexual contact. Most mycoplasma infections are symptom-free, but occasionally the infection can cause symptoms that are different for men and womenMycoplasma genitalium symptoms in men include:pain when going for a peewhite discharge from the penisburning or itching in the tube that carries urine out of the body (urethra)testicular paindiscomfort or discharge from your anus (if you’ve had anal sex)Mycoplasma genitalium symptoms in women include:pain when going for a peeunusual vaginal dischargetummy or pelvis painpain during sexbleeding after sexpainful bleeding between periodsdiscomfort or discharge from your anus (if you’ve had anal sex)What happens if mycoplasma genitalium is left untreated?The infection can cause PID in women, which can lead to reduced fertility. Therefore, if you think you may have been infected with mycoplasma, it is important to get tested as soon as possible. TrichomoniasisTrichomoniasis is an STI that’s caused by a parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis and is spread through unprotected vaginal sex. The symptoms usually develop within a month of infection. Although half of people do not experience any symptoms, they can still pass the infection on. The symptoms are similar to other STIs which is why it is important to get tested so you can receive the right treatment. Trichomoniasis symptoms in women include:unusual vaginal discharge that may be thick, think, frothy, or yellow-greenincreased vaginal discharge that may have a fishy smellsoreness, swelling, or vaginal itchingpain or discomfort when going for a pee or having sexTrichomoniasis symptoms in men include:pain when going for a pee or during ejaculationpeeing more often than usualthin, white discharge from the penissoreness, swelling, and redness around the head of the penis or foreskinWhat happens if trichomoniasis is left untreated?Long-term complications caused by trichomoniasis are rare, but some women can be at an increased risk of further complications. In pregnant women, trichomoniasis can cause premature birth or a low birth weight in babies. UreaplasmaUreaplasma is a bacteria that’s passed between people during sexual contact. A large number of sexually active people are infected with ureaplasma and it causes no symptoms. However, it may cause pain when you go for a pee or needing to pee more often than usual. It is important to test for ureaplasma as it has been associated with other genitourinary (urinary and reproductive) tract infections, pregnancy complications, and neonatal diseases when passed from a pregnant person to their baby. Gardnerella vaginalisGardnerella vaginalis is a normal member of the vaginal microenvironment or microbiome. However, high numbers cause bacterial vaginosis in women and rarely, urethritis (a swollen urethra) in men. Bacterial vaginosis symptoms include:unusual vaginal discharge with a strong, fishy smellchanges in colour or consistency of your dischargeIt is important to get treatment if you have a positive Gardnerella vaginalis result and you’re experiencing symptoms as it can lead to:an increased risk of getting STIsPIDpregnancy complications",

    "answer": "HPV, or the human papillomavirus, is a group of very common viruses with over 100 different types. While most cause no problems and go away on their own, some high-risk strains can cause cancer and some low-risk strains can cause genital warts. Getting tested regularly for HPV can help you catch the infection before it affects your cells and develops into a more serious condition. Our home HPV test kit involves taking a swab of your vagina and sending it off for testing in a partner lab.",

    "question": "What is a HPV test?",
    "answer": "A HPV test is a vaginal swab test that checks for high-risk HPV strains, which can increase your risk of certain cancers, such as cervical cancer.Our HPV test detects strains 16 and 18 individually, as well as a panel test for other high-risk strains: 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 69, 73 and 82. Not all of these strains may be tested for by the NHS cervical screening (smear testing) service.What’s the difference between a HPV test and a smear test?A HPV test looks for certain high-risk HPV strains in your vagina and can be done at home. The swab only needs to be inserted a few centimetres into your vagina and takes a sample from the vagina walls. The sample is sent to a lab and the results will let you know whether you have a high-risk strain, and what to do next. A smear test is carried out by a nurse or doctor, not at home. It involves using a speculum to open up the vagina, and a soft brush to take a sample of the cells in your cervix. Your cervix is at the top of your vagina, so the swab goes deeper inside than a HPV test does. In the UK, cervical screening works by testing the cervical cells for high-risk HPV strains. If a high-risk HPV is found, the cells will be tested for changes. Not all cervical cell changes will develop into cancer, but your doctor may want to monitor you more regularly or provide treatment to remove the abnormal cells.",

    "question": "Who should get tested for HPV?",
    "answer": "HPV testing is recommended for all women and people with a cervix, usually from the ages of 25 to 64. This is because cervical cancer is rare in people under 25 and over 64. It can affect anyone, even if you’ve only had sex once, or you’re in a long-term relationship with only 1 person. Some people are at a higher risk of getting HPV, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), so you may be offered regular anal HPV screening. Your risk of HPV is also higher if you:started having sex at a younger agehave had a lot of sexual partnershave HIVYou should not use the HPV test if you are pregnant. Speak to your doctor or midwife if you’re concerned about HPV while being pregnant.Why should I get tested for HPV?You might want to get tested for HPV if you’re worried you’ve got the infection, such as if a sexual partner tells you they’ve tested positive for a high-risk strain. Untreated HPV can lead to genital warts and cancer, so it’s good to get tested if you’re worried about getting it and are sexually active. Can men use a HPV test?Our home HPV test is specifically for women, but men can get tested too. HPV can cause some cancers in men but the risk is lower. Particularly, men who have sex with men should get regular anal screening for HPV.",

If you cannot make an appointment with your doctor or would prefer to do the test at home, you can request our home HPV test kit from ZAVA. Most women in the UK are vaccinated against HPV, but if you’re not, regular screening can help keep you safe. At the age of 25, you’ll be invited for regular NHS cervical screenings. You don’t need to test for HPV every time you have sex with a new partner, as long as your last HPV screening was normal. It can sometimes take weeks, months, or years for the virus to be detected.",

    "question": "How to use a HPV test at home",
    "answer": "Our HPV home test is in the form of a vaginal swab, it is not the same as a cervical smear. Your vaginal swab does not need to be inserted deeply, making it more comfortable, pain-free and easier to use. The HPV home test kit comes with everything you need for the test, as well as an instruction leaflet. You do not need equipment, like a speculum that is used in smear tests.Make sure to wash your hands before and after using the test with warm, soapy water.Using the test kit:Sit in a comfortable position to do the test, either standing up with one leg on a chair or sitting on the toilet with your legs apart.Twist the cap from the sample tube and remove the swab.Put the tube somewhere safe and upright, as you’ll need to put the swab back inside the tube when you’re done. Hold the swab on the coloured line, around halfway down the stick.Fold back the skin that covers your vagina, making sure to avoid the tip of the swab touching anything. Gently insert the swab into your vagina – do not go any further than the coloured mark on the stick.Rotate the swab gently around the vagina walls for about 20 seconds.Gently remove the swab and place it inside the sample tube, securing the lid.Fill out your details on the label provided and attach it to the tube. This is very important so that the lab can process your sample. Place the tube inside the protective packaging and prepaid envelope. You can post your sample from any local post box.",

What does a negative HPV test result mean?A negative HPV test result means you are not currently infected with a high-risk strain. You do not need follow-up tests or treatment unless there’s a reason you need to take another test in the future. If you do not have the HPV vaccination, we recommend considering it. You can speak with your GP for more information on the HPV vaccine and the benefits of getting it. To keep your chances of getting HPV low, we recommend safe, protected sex. What does a positive HPV test result mean?A positive HPV test result means you are currently infected with a high-risk strain. You should make an appointment with your GP straight away and let them know your results. You’ll need a colposcopy, a procedure that looks for abnormal cells in your cervix. Your GP may recommend removing the abnormal cells if any are found.Please note: Testing positive for HPV does not mean you have cancer. It means that you’re at a higher risk of developing certain types of cancers, like cervical or vaginal cancer. The colposcopy will check if any of your cells are abnormal. If they are not, HPV is likely to go away on its own, but you may need some follow-up tests to make sure it does.",

    "question": "What is HPV?",
    "answer": "HPV is a group of viruses, with more than 100 types. Most people will have it at some point in their life and it's most common inside the throat, mouth, genitals, and anus. HPV is very easy to catch through skin-to-skin contact, usually in sexually active people. Due to how common the virus is, the HPV vaccine is typically given to children between the ages of 12 to 13, and to other people who are at a higher risk of catching it. The vaccine is the best way to prevent getting a high-risk HPV strain but there’s still a very small chance of catching it. HPV strainsMost HPV strains are low-risk and cause no problems but there are around 14 high-risk strains. High-risk HPV strains can develop into cancer, particularly of the cervix. The most common causes of cervical cancer are HPV 16 and 18, which lead to around 70% of all cervical cancer cases. Some low-risk strains can cause warts in or around the throat, mouth, genitals, and anus and are usually passed through sex. Other cancers associated with high-risk HPV strains include:some types of head and neck cancervaginal cancervulval cancerpenile canceranal cancerSymptoms of HPVHPV does not usually cause any symptoms unless it develops into another condition. As high-risk strains can cause cervical cancer, you must speak with your doctor straight away if you notice:abnormal vaginal bleeding, such as after sex, between periods, or after menopausea change in your periods, such as them being heavier, lighter or longer than normalpain during sexpain in the pelvis, lower back, or lower stomachabnormal vaginal discharge, such as a watery consistency, a strong odour, or it contains blood“Symptoms of cervical cancer are also associated with other common conditions like an infection or endometriosis. Having these symptoms does not mean you definitely have cervical cancer but it’s still important to get checked by your GP. They may want to do some tests to make sure. It’s also important that you attend your cervical screening exams.” Dr Brenda Ikeji, Medical Editor.How HPV is spreadHPV is easily spread through skin-to-skin contact and most commonly through sexual contact. You can get HPV from:sharing sex toysvaginal, oral, and anal sexskin-to-skin contact of the genital areasYou do not need to have penetrative sex to catch HPV and you can get it even if you’ve only had one sexual partner. Risks of leaving HPV untreatedHPV is known to cause genital warts and cancer in some cases. Fortunately, most HPV strains don’t cause any problems, and your body will clear them up on its own within 2 years.",

    "answer": "Oral chlamydia and gonorrhoea are sexually transmitted infections (STIs) which can occur in the throat after coming into contact with an infected person. You can also get these STIs around the genitals or anus. These infections almost always cause no symptoms, so you aren’t likely to know you have them without taking a test. You can still pass them on to sexual partners, and leaving either untreated for too long can cause long-term health complications. Oral chlamydia and gonorrhoea can be detected on a test using a throat swab, at least 2 weeks after coming into contact with the infection. This can be done at home in a few simple steps.",

    "question": "Who should get tested for oral chlamydia and gonorrhoea?",
    "answer": "Oral STIs are less common than those of the genital but they still happen. You should get tested if you have unprotected oral sex, especially if you get any symptoms or a sexual partner tells you they have an infection.You’re most at risk if you’re:with a new sexual partner or change partners frequently and do not use a barrier contraceptive method during oral sex a man who has sex with men – most cases of gonorrhoea affect gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with menIf none of the above applies, the NHS recommends testing for STIs once a year if you’re under 25 and having any kind of unprotected sex, including anal, oral, and vaginal. Why should I get tested for oral chlamydia and gonorrhoea?It’s important to get tested for oral chlamydia and gonorrhoea because they’re the most common STIs, so they’re most likely to be contracted if you do have regular unprotected oral sex. Both infections can be passed easily and cause long-term health complications if left untreated for too long. They can be especially dangerous for a pregnant woman. Regular testing can reduce the number of cases and protect other sexual partners from catching the infection.",

So, if you’re taking an oral chlamydia and gonorrhoea test you need to wait 2 weeks for accurate results. If you get tested before this, do another test after this time frame has passed.

    "question": "What is chlamydia?",
    "answer": "Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the UK. This is partly because it's often symptomless and so people do not know they have it without regular STI testing (at least once a year). The symptoms of chlamydia include:pain during urination (peeing)unusual discharge from the vagina, penis, or anus (bottom)in women – pain in the stomach, bleeding after sex, and bleeding between periods (spotting) in men – pain and swelling of the testiclesOral chlamydia usually causes no symptoms but it can cause mouth sores, sore throat, swollen neck glands, and fevers.How it’s spreadChlamydia is a bacterial infection that’s spread through unprotected oral, anal, or vaginal sex, or in any other way that you may come into contact with infected semen or vaginal fluid. This means you cannot spread oral chlamydia by kissing but it can be passed through things like sharing unwashed sex toys or getting fluid in your mouth. It can also be passed from a pregnant woman to her child during birth if the infection is in the vagina. Are there any risks of leaving chlamydia untreated?Yes, leaving chlamydia untreated can cause long-term health problems as the infection can spread. This includes:in women – pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can then cause pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancyin pregnant women – premature labour and birth, a low birth weight, and the risk of passing chlamydia to the baby during birthin men – epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis tube behind the testicles) in menin anyone – reactive arthritisIf you pass chlamydia to your baby, they may develop an eye or lung infection.

The symptoms of gonorrhoea are also different for men and women. Oral gonorrhoea usually has no symptoms, but it can cause sore throat, white spots in the mouth and swollen neck glands.Gonorrhoea symptoms in men include:unusual penis discharge, such as being white, yellow, or greenpain or burning during urinationswelling of the foreskinpain or tenderness in the testicles (rare)Gonorrhoea symptoms in women include:unusual vaginal discharge, such as being thin or watery, and green or yellowpain or burning during urinationpain or tenderness in the lower stomach (uncommon)spotting, heavier periods, and bleeding after sex (uncommon)How it’s spreadGonorrhoea is caused by a bacteria usually found in vaginal and penis discharge. It’s passed through unprotected oral, vaginal, and anal sex, or in any other way that fluid may come into contact with your genitals, anus, mouth, or eyes. This includes things like sharing sex toys that are not clean. Recently there has been some evidence that suggests that oral gonorrhoea can also be transmitted through kissing. Gonorrhoea can be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby during birth if the infection is in the vagina. Are there any risks of leaving gonorrhoea untreated?Yes, the bacteria that causes gonorrhoea can spread, causing further complications. This includes:in women – PID which may then cause pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancyin pregnant women – miscarriage, and premature labour and birthwhen passed to a newborn baby – conjunctivitis, which is not promptly treated can cause blindnessin men – a painful infection in the prostate gland and testicles, which may cause infertility in rare instancesin anyone – sepsis (a life-threatening infection)If treated early enough, it’s very unlikely to cause any long-term health problems but the more times you get gonorrhoea, the more likely complications are.

Wash and dry your hands before filling out the sample label and attaching it to the tube.Your sample can now be packaged up using the prepaid envelope and posted in any UK post box. Do I have to take a blood test for the genital herpes test?No, our home test kit for genital herpes involves taking a swab of the fluid from one of the sores or blisters and is not a blood test. You can get a blood test to check for antibodies to the herpes virus if you don’t currently have any symptoms.",

This does not guarantee that you are not infected with the herpes virus as the virus may not always be detectable, especially if symptoms are recent or mild. If you still have symptoms, or they come back, you should take another test or speak with your doctor about testing for other possible causes of these symptoms.Positive resultA positive result means the herpes virus (HSV1 or HSV2) was found in your sample, and that you have genital herpes. The test will let you know which strain was found in your sample. If you test positive, our doctors will be on hand to provide expert advice on your next steps and provide the best herpes treatments to help manage your symptoms.",

    "question": "What should I do if I test positive for genital herpes?",
    "answer": "If you test positive for genital herpes, our doctors can advise you on the best treatment to manage your symptoms and protect yourself and your sexual partners. Can herpes be treated?No, there is no cure for herpes, but outbreaks can be managed and suppressed with antiviral medications.Treatment options include:antiviral medications such as aciclovir, famciclovir and valaciclovir to reduce the length of outbreaks or suppress the virus (so you are less likely to give it to sexual partners)numbing cream such as lidocaine (a local anaesthetic cream) to provide pain relief to the affected areaYou can reduce the chances of passing genital herpes onto others by:using a condom every time you have vaginal, anal or oral sex (note that if the condom does not cover the infected area then herpes can be passed on)avoiding sex if you or your partner has blisters, sores or a tingle or itch that may be the start of an outbreakavoiding sharing sex toys if possible, or washing them and putting a condom on them between sexual partnersWhy do I need to test myself for genital herpes?Genital herpes is contagious so you can spread it unknowingly to sexual partners if you don’t know you have the infection. It can be spread even when you have no symptoms, although this is less common. Risks of leaving genital herpes untreatedIt’s not likely for genital herpes to cause many long-term effects, but getting a test and the right treatment can reduce the severity and length of an outbreak, and stop you from getting multiple outbreaks. If you have genital herpes and you’re pregnant, there’s a risk your baby can develop an illness called neonatal herpes. This can be fatal so your baby will need antiviral treatment. If you don’t know you have the infection, there’s a risk that your baby could get seriously ill. Genital herpes and other conditionsYou might need more regular sexual health screening as genital herpes can increase your chances of becoming infected with HIV. It can also be more serious if you have HIV.Genital herpes can cause similar symptoms to some other infections, like syphilis or genital warts, so it’s important to have a test to make sure that you get the right treatment.",

    "question": "What is trichomoniasis?",
    "answer": "Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a parasite known as trichomonas vaginalis. Nearly half of all cases are asymptomatic (showing no symptoms), so it can be spread or caught without realising. When it does show symptoms, they can be similar to other STIs, making it difficult to identify without appropriate testing. These symptoms also differ between men and women. When left untreated, trichomoniasis can lead to complications like: making you more likely to catch other STIsproblems with pregnancy and childbirthtriggering inflammation that makes it easier to catch and spread HIVFortunately, with the right treatment and intervention, trichomoniasis is entirely curable and manageable. If you think you’ve been exposed to trichomoniasis, it’s important to get tested and treated as quickly as possible to stop it from spreading and deal with the infection before any complications.How does trichomoniasis spread?Like other STIs, trichomoniasis tends to spread through unprotected sexual contact (not using a condom). It can also be spread through sharing sex toys without thoroughly cleaning them before use. You cannot catch trichomoniasis through: oral or anal sexkissinghuggingsharing cutlery and platesusing the same toilet seat as someone who’s been infected The best way to protect yourself from trichomoniasis is to make sure you use a condom and practice safe sex. How common is trichomoniasis?Trichomoniasis is the world's most common non-viral STI. However, it is still significantly less prevalent than STIs like chlamydia, especially in the UK, where there are only an estimated 6,000 new cases reported each year. Chlamydia saw over 190,000 new cases in 2023 alone. The main reason trichomoniasis is so common compared to other non-viral STIs is because it is often symptomless or confused for a different infection. While all genders can get trichomoniasis, it's more common in women, and older women are more likely to have the infection.Is trichomoniasis an STI?Yes, trichomoniasis is an STI, called a non-viral STI because it is caused by a parasite rather than a virus. So, while it is slightly different to other STIs, it’s still considered an STI as it is transmitted primarily through having sex.",

    "question": "What causes trichomoniasis?",
    "answer": "Trichomoniasis is caused by trichomonas vaginalis, a tiny parasite that passes from person to person through unprotected sexual contact. It can infect your genitals or prostate. It’s carried in sexual fluids, including semen, pre cum, and vaginal fluids. While it’s significantly less common, trichomoniasis can be spread through sharing damp towels that have been in contact with the infection or anything similar.",

    "question": "What are the symptoms of trichomoniasis?",
    "answer": "Trichomoniasis has no symptoms nearly 50% of the time, and when these do appear, they differ between genders and can be very similar to other STIs. This makes knowing the symptoms, knowing what to look out for, and getting appropriate testing important. Common trichomoniasis symptoms in people assigned female at birth include:vaginal discharge, which can be thick, thin, frothy, or yellow-greenmore discharge than usual, which may also have a fishy smellsoreness, swelling and itching around the vagina, including sometimes the inner thighspain or discomfort when urinating or having sexCommon trichomoniasis symptoms in people assigned male at birth include:pain when urinating or during ejaculationurinating a lot more than usualthin, white dischargesoreness, swelling and redness around the head of the penis or foreskinHow do you know if you have trichomoniasis?The only way to know for sure if you have trichomoniasis is with testing. This is because trichomoniasis can be symptomless or have symptoms very similar to other STIs, making it difficult to diagnose without testing first. If you think you’ve been exposed to trichomoniasis or you’ve been informed by someone else who has, you should get tested. We provide home test kits that you can take wherever you’re comfortable, without the need to visit a clinic or speak to a GP face-to-face. These tests are also just as accurate as the tests carried out in sexual health clinics, so you can be certain you’re getting accurate results. How long does trichomoniasis last?Trichomoniasis is very unlikely to go away without getting the right treatment, which means it can last for years or never go away on its own. With treatment, trichomoniasis usually clears up within 7 days, but you can be reinfected if exposed again. Getting a repeat test 3 months after treatment is recommended to make sure you don’t have a repeat infection and it’s completely cleared up.",

    "question": "How is trichomoniasis diagnosed?",
    "answer": "Trichomoniasis is diagnosed with a test kit that either involves taking a swab of the area or if you have a penis, a urine sample can also be used for testing. You can test for trichomoniasis at home with a home test kit, like the ones we provide, or at a sexual health clinic. Home testing is considered to be just as accurate as the testing you’d get at a clinic or GP surgery, and it’s entirely discreet. You can test at home with ZAVA in a few simple steps:Order your test kit online.

We can also provide treatment for trichomoniasis, and other STIs if your results show that you need it.IMPORTANT: You can not be prescribed treatment for trichomoniasis until you’ve been tested for the infection and have a positive test result. This is because it’s the only way to make sure you have trichomoniasis and not another infection.When should you get tested for trichomoniasis?To get the most accurate results from a trichomoniasis test, you should test 1 to 4 weeks after you think you’ve been exposed to the infection. You should get tested for trichomoniasis if you: think you have recently been exposed to the infection after having unprotected sexare informed by a recent sexual partner that they have the infectionhave symptoms of trichomoniasis",

    "question": "What is PrEP?",
    "answer": "PrEP is a tablet you take daily or ‘on demand’ (when you have sex) to stay protected from HIV. When taken daily and correctly, it can reduce your risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99%.PrEP is a type of medication called an antiretroviral. These medications work by reducing the amount of HIV in the body to a very low level or removing it completely. ‘PrE’ stands for ‘Pre-Exposure’ because PrEP is only effective if it is taken before exposure to HIV. The other ‘P’ stands for ‘Prophylaxis’, meaning a treatment or action you take to prevent an infection or disease. Simply put, PrEP protects you from HIV before you contract it.What does pre-exposure prophylaxis mean?‘Pre-exposure’ means ‘before coming into contact with’ something, in this case, HIV. ‘Prophylaxis’ is a treatment that protects you from getting an infection. So pre-exposure prophylaxis means taking a treatment to protect yourself from HIV before coming into contact with the virus. Think of it as a proactive way to significantly reduce your risk of an HIV infection.",

Studies show that the PrEP once-daily regime reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by around 99%. Further studies found that PrEP effectiveness sat at around 93% in people who took it regularly, however, this was reduced to 86% in people who had periods of stopping and starting PrEP. \"It is very important to take PrEP exactly as directed. Not doing so can increase your chances of getting HIV if you are exposed. For PrEP to be most effective, it must be taken daily. You should also continue to practice safe sex and use condoms to minimise your risk completely. It’s also vital to remember that even while using PrEP, you are also still vulnerable to other STIs.\" — Dr Brenda Ikeji, Medical Editor",

    "question": "How to take PrEP",
    "answer": "How you take PrEP will depend on whether you plan to take it daily or on demand, and what works best for you will depend on your lifestyle and needs. DailyWhen you take PrEP daily, you: take 1 tablet every day, so you’re always protected from HIVtake it ideally at the same time each dayYou will need to start taking PrEP daily for at least 7 days before you want to have sex for it to work, but you’ll be protected going forward after that. Daily PrEP is an excellent option if you don’t like to plan sex or you don’t want to worry about remembering to take PrEP when you do have sex, as it’s already part of your daily routine. Taking PrEP daily is also very effective in preventing HIV as it keeps you up to 99% protected from infection.On-demandOn-demand means you only take PrEP when you need to. To do this, you:take 2 tablets between 2 and 24 hours before having sextake 1 tablet 24 hours after sextake 1 tablet 48 hours after sexIf you continue to have sex after that and over a period of time, keep taking 1 tablet every 24 hours until you’ve not had sex for at least 2 days.If you don’t have sex regularly or don’t want to remember to take a tablet every day, on-demand PrEP is a great way of making sure you’re protected from HIV when you need to.Taking PrEP on demand can be just as effective as taking it daily, as long as you remember to take it on time. Missing even 1 tablet can reduce the effectiveness of your treatment. When should I start taking PrEP?You should start daily PrEP 7 days before you want to have sex, as it takes 7 days to work. If you want to have sex in these 7 days, you can stay protected by taking 2 tablets at least 2 hours before sex. Then continue taking it daily. You should start taking PrEP on demand 2 to 24 hours before having anal sex. Then, continue the treatment schedule to stay protected.PrEP is meant to be taken as a preventative measure before you have sex. If you’ve had sex and think there’s a chance that you’ve been exposed to HIV, you’ll need a different treatment called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). You can get this from a sexual health clinic and it must be taken within 72 hours of exposure. If it’s a weekend or you cannot access a sexual health clinic for any reason, PEP is also available at A&E. Do I need to be HIV negative before taking PrEP?Yes, you must be HIV-negative before taking PrEP. PrEP is only a treatment that reduces the risk of getting HIV. It's not a treatment for HIV. Taking PrEP while you are HIV positive can cause drug resistance, which can actually make it more difficult to treat HIV.How long should I take PrEP for?PrEP can be taken continuously for as long as you need to take it. However, if you get exposed to HIV or have HIV symptoms, you should inform your doctor, stop taking PrEP, and take a HIV test. You should wait for a negative result before resuming PrEP, as it cannot treat HIV, and you could develop drug resistance if you take it when you are HIV positive.If you wish to stop taking PrEP and have not been exposed to HIV or do not have symptoms, you should discuss with a doctor how to stop taking PrEP, as this will depend on the type of sex you last had.",

However, any medication has the potential to cause side effects which can vary from person to person.As with most medication, vomiting, breathing difficulties, swelling of the skin or a rash may occur if you have an allergy or intolerance to any of the components of the medication. If you develop any of these symptoms after taking PrEP, stop it immediately and seek medical attention urgently.Most people who take PrEP will not experience side effects, but if they do, these usually resolve within a few weeks. Common side effects include:Diarrhoea or vomitingHeartburn or indigestionHeadachesDizzinessTiredness or insomniaAbnormal dreamsRashesPain or feeling weakChanges in your liver enzymesChanges in the levels of your blood sugar and blood fatsLowering of your white blood cellsAre there any long-term side effects?PrEP can affect kidneys and bones over the long term in some people. You will need to have a kidney test before you start taking PrEP, and our doctors will also ask about your medical history.In the PROUD study participants reported few side effects, and almost everyone who stopped PrEP because of side effects were able to start PrEP again. No significant health effects have been seen in people who are HIV-negative and have taken PrEP for up to 5 years.If you develop any of the above side effects or any other symptoms, please see your GP to investigate this.Always make sure you read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication before starting the medication.",

    "question": "How should you care for yourself while taking PrEP?",
    "answer": "To take care of yourself while taking PrEP, it’s important to take any tests requested by a doctor, such as your 3-month continuation PrEP test. This test makes sure you can stay on PrEP and it checks your HIV status and kidney function. If your kidney function is normal and you are HIV-negative, you can continue taking PrEP for another 3 months. We provide this test kit so you can do it at home. Once a year you will also need to check your HIV status, kidney function, and Hepatitis B or C status (if this applies to you). We provide an annual continuation PrEP test kit that enables you to test for all of this at home too.We also recommend getting regular STI screenings while you’re on PrEP, which we can also provide. While PrEP helps protect you from HIV, you’re still vulnerable to other STIs, especially if you’re not using protection during sex. So a good way of taking care of yourself while on PrEP is to make sure you’re still practicing safe sex. Getting more supportDepending on your circumstances, you may need a little more support while taking PrEP. These resources may be helpful if needed:Mermaids – a charity that supports trans, non-binary and gender-diverse children, young people and their familiesGay Men Fighting AIDS (also known as GMFA) – a group that provides information on the history of HIV and its treatment to keep you informed and combat the stigma associated with it.",

    "question": "PrEP FAQs",
    "answer": "Does PrEP protect you from other STIs?PrEP does not offer any protection from other STIs, it only protects you against HIV.Is PrEP the same as PEP?No, PrEP is designed to prevent HIV and is taken before a risk of exposure. PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) is taken as an emergency after possible exposure to HIV.Does PrEP cure HIV?No, PrEP is not suitable for people who are HIV positive.Is PrEP effective after exposure?PrEP must be taken both before and after exposure at the intervals directed to be effective. Only taking PrEP after exposure is not effective. If you think you have been exposed to HIV, contact a doctor or sexual health clinic immediately.Is PrEP safer than condoms?PrEP only protects you against HIV, whereas condoms offer protection against both HIV and other STIs.Does PrEP affect male fertility?According to this study, taking PrEP does not affect the fertility of men who are HIV negative.How many hours late can I take PrEP?If you are daily dosing, you should take your tablet at about the same time every day to maintain sufficient levels of the drug in your body to protect you from getting HIV. If you forget, take it as soon as you remember, and get in touch with your doctor or sexual health clinic. Do not take more than one tablet at a time.If you are dosing ‘on-demand’ or ‘event-based’ before and after sex, you must take PrEP at the correct intervals. If you do not, contact your doctor or sexual health clinic immediately.How do you know if someone is on PrEP?There is no way you can tell if someone else is taking PrEP. Only you can be sure if you are using PrEP to protect you from HIV.Can you take PrEP with contraception?Yes, PrEP can be used safely with all contraceptive methods.Can I use PrEP while pregnant or breastfeeding?PrEP is not known to affect your chances of pregnancy. It can be safely used by pregnant and/or breastfeeding women.Can PrEP be used as PEP? No, PrEP can not be used as PEP. While the same medication can be used for both treatments, they are taken in different ways and require different dosing and scheduling. PrEP is to be taken before you have sex and is known as pre-exposure treatment, while PEP is for post-exposure (after you have had sex). PEP is often a combination of 3 medications, while PrEP is usually 2.Does PrEP interact with other drugs or alcohol?PrEP does not interact with alcohol, so it’s usually safe to take while drinking. However, taking recreational drugs while on PrEP may change how they affect you, especially if you’re new to PrEP or have just started taking it. Recreational drugs can also increase your likelihood of experiencing side effects with PrEP, so it’s best to inform your doctor if you are taking recreational drugs when requesting PrEP.",

It works in the same way as Truvada, a branded version of PrEP which is typically prescribed in the US. To recieve this treatment you must be HIV negative and have a higher risk of HIV exposure. You also need to take certain tests before and while using PrEP. We explain more about these requirements, below.Do you have a higher risk of getting HIV?You might have a higher risk if you have sex without a condom with someone whose HIV status you’re unsure of, and you:are a man who has sex with menare transgender and have sex with menare a woman who has sex with bisexual partnershave sex with someone from a country with a high rate of HIVYou may also have a higher risk if you:have sex with someone who is HIV positive and has a detectable viral load (meaning the amount of the virus in their blood is high enough that it can be found)take drugs using needles and share those needles with othersare a sex workerget STIs (sexually transmitted infections) on a regular basisThere could be other factors that put you at a higher risk of getting HIV.What tests do you need to take PrEP?If you wanted to request emtricitabine/tenofovir from us, our doctors will ask whether you’ve had:a negative HIV test resulta normal kidney function test resulta negative hepatitis B and C test result — you only need a negative hepatitis B result if you’ve not had a hepatitis B vaccination, and you only need a negative hepatitis C result if you are a man who has sex with other men or are a trans womanIt’s also recommended that you do a full screen test for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).You can continue to request PrEP if you haven’t had one or more of these tests. However, you must take these tests before you begin taking PrEP. You can order any PrEP tests you need from us and carry these out at home.",

This means they work in the exact same way and they are just as effective as each other, only they may contain different non-active ingredients, and have a different name and price. Truvada is most commonly available in the US, whereas the unbranded ‘generic PrEP’ (emtricitabine/tenofovir) is more widely prescribed in the UK than Truvada.",

    "question": "How does emtricitabine/tenofovir work?",
    "answer": "Emtricitabine/tenofovir are antiviral drugs that work by protecting the body’s immune cells from HIV. The medication blocks the activity of the enzymes responsible for HIV and stops the virus from growing and spreading to other body cells. These medications do not cure HIV, but can help to prevent the infection if you have been exposed to it.How long does emtricitabine/tenofovir take to work?It takes about 7 days of daily use to have maximum protection when used for vaginal sex. When taken for anal sex, it is taken on demand and you can be protected within a couple of hours of the first double-dose.Missing a dose of emtricitabine/tenofovir can make the medication less effective. How long does emtricitabine/tenofovir stay in your system?Research has estimated that it stays in your body for up to 7 days. The half-life of emtricitabine is approximately 10 hours, and the half-life of tenofovir is around 12 to 18 hours.",

If it’s outside of normal working hours, go to your local A&E department instead.Is emtricitabine/tenofovir safer than condoms?Emtricitabine/tenofovir only protects you from HIV. Using a condom is a much safer option as condoms offer protection from a range of STIs, as well as HIV.It’s recommended that you get tested for STIs every 3 months, including an HIV test.Is undetectable HIV safe?Studies have shown that people with an undetectable HIV viral load cannot pass on the virus to others. An ‘undetectable viral load’ means that the amount of the virus in their blood is not able to be found.The PARTNER 2 study found that people taking effective HIV treatment with an undetectable viral load, did not pass on the virus to their sexual partners.",

    "question": "How do you take emtricitabine/tenofovir?",
    "answer": "You should take emtricitabine/tenofovir, preferably with food, at the same time each day. It's important to take emtricitabine/tenofovir as prescribed by your doctor.If your PrEP request is approved, carefully read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication once you receive it. Do this before taking emtricitabine/tenofovir for the first time.What dose of emtricitabine/tenofovir should you take?We offer 200mg emtricitabine and 245mg tenofovir, to be taken daily. These are provided together (i.e. you do not need to request these separately).What should you do if you miss a dose of emtricitabine/tenofovir?If you forget to take your emtricitabine/tenofovir tablet for the day, but:remember within 12 hours of when you normally take it – you can still take itremember after 12 hours –skip that day’s dose and take it as usual the next day.

This type of PrEP can provide effective protection for men when having anal sex without a condom. It is not recommended for vaginal sex.PrEp on-demand works on a 2-1-1 schedule. This means that you take:2 pills 2 to 24 hours before you have sex 1 pill 24 hours after the first dose1 pill 24 hours after the second doseIf you continue to have sex for a longer period of time, then you should also keep taking 1 pill every 24 hours until you have not had sex for 2 days. What is event-driven PrEP?Event-driven PrEP is similar to on-demand PrEP. It is when you take PrEP when you want to have sex. It can be taken using the 2-1-1 schedule, like on-demand PrEP, or it can be used on a 2-7 schedule. The 2-7 schedule involves taking a double dose of PrEP before sex and then taking a pill daily for the next 7 days. This can also be an option for people having vaginal sex.",

Once you begin taking PrEP, you will need to repeat these tests at different periods too.Why are these tests important?HIV testIt may be unsafe to take PrEP if you’re HIV positive. The antiviral drugs in PrEP (emtricitabine and tenofovir) are often used to treat people with HIV, alongside other medications. You can become resistant to these drugs if you use them when you’re already HIV positive. This can make it more challenging to treat the infection later on. If you have flu-like symptoms after unprotected sex, like a fever or a rash, you should check that you’re HIV negative before taking PrEP. You may need to take PEP instead. Scroll up to learn more (‘Is emtricitabine/tenofovir effective after exposure?’).Different HIV tests have different timeframes for testing after unprotected sex. Follow the instructions for your chosen test to make sure the results are accurate. Our HIV test kit is over 99% accurate at detecting HIV if you test 6 weeks after possible exposure to HIV. You can test any time before that, but if you get a negative result, you should repeat your test to make sure your results are accurate.Kidney functionThe two antiviral drugs in PrEP are used by the body and then passed out in your urine through your kidneys. You need to check that your kidneys are working properly otherwise these drugs can build up in your body and cause damage.Hepatitis B and CIf you have hepatitis, taking and subsequently stopping PrEP can lead to a flare up of liver inflammation and your hepatitis getting worse. It can also affect any future hepatitis treatment you receive and make it harder to treat your condition.What are the side effects of emtricitabine/tenofovir?As with all medications, emtricitabine/tenofovir can have side effects. These usually go away within a few weeks. Most people don’t experience any side effects.Common side effects of emtricitabine/tenofovir include:feeling sick and being sick (vomiting)diarrhoeaheadachesdizzinessfeeling weakpain in the stomachfeeling bloatedproblems with sleepingrashes or swelling of the skinLess common side effects include:anaemia (a lack of red blood cells, or haemoglobin, in the blood)muscle weakness and painyellow and itchy eyespain in the bonesjoint stiffnessback paina condition called lactic acidosis, where lactic acid builds up in the body, causing drowsiness and difficulty with breathingIf you experience any serious side effects, you should go to A&E immediately.",

Dry your hands thoroughly.Take one of the swabs and wipe the fingertip you’d like to collect your sample from. We recommend that you avoid using a finger you write with. Wait until your fingertip is completely dry.Twist the cap and remove the purple stick from one of the lancets. Place this on the middle of your fingertip. Press the purple button to prick your finger.You should see a drop of blood start to form on your fingertip. If this doesn’t happen, try this again on a different finger using one of the extra lancets.Take a tissue and use it to wipe the first drop of blood away. Then place the collection tube upright in the groove of the plastic container on a flat surface. This will make it easier to collect your sample as you may need both hands to do this.Point your finger down over the collection tube. Squeeze each side of your fingertip so that drops of blood fall into the collection tube. Do this until the tube is filled to the top line. If there’s not enough blood to fill the tube, use one of the extra lancets on a different finger and repeat the first steps.When you’ve finished, cover your fingertip with the plaster.Place the lid back on the collection tube. Make sure it’s screwed on tightly.Write your details on the sticky label and stick this to the collection tube.

It is caused by a common virus called the herpes simplex virus (HSV) which often appears through outbreaks and causes symptoms like a red blistered rash. In many cases, genital herpes is symptomless. How does genital herpes spread?Genital herpes can be spread by:unprotected sexskin contact with infected areasskin contact with areas where herpes blisters or sores are not visiblethe infection being carried on skin, such as fingers or hands, from someone else’s genitals to yoursusing sex toys used by someone who has herpesa cold sore coming into contact with your genitalsWhile genital herpes virus is contagious and easily transmittable from skin to skin, there is no risk of getting it from surfaces such as tables, door knobs, and toilet seats.How common is genital herpes?HSV, the virus which causes herpes, is very common. HSV is split into HSV-1 and HSV-2 types. HSV-2 causes genital herpes and a recent study from 2022 estimated that around 12.4% of the European general population have been exposed to this virus. However, not everyone with HSV-2 shows symptoms, so it is important to get tested not only if you have symptoms but also if you think you may be infected.",

    "question": "What are the symptoms of genital herpes?",
    "answer": "The main symptoms of genital herpes are blisters which burst open and leave you with sores. They are usually red but can appear differently on black or brown skin and occur around the genitals, thighs, bottom or anus.Other genital symptoms may include:pain when taking a peetingling sensationitching or burning around the genital areasunusual dischargeWhen you first contract HSV-2 in your genital area it is called the primary infection. The first outbreak symptoms after exposure to the virus are usually the worst and outbreaks after are usually milder. How often does genital herpes flare up?Clinical studies have found patients experiencing 6 to 10 recurrences of genital herpes within a year after first exposure to the virus. However, this can vary from person to person, some may experience less recurrence, it depends on how regularly you are exposed to triggers. For example, if you get an outbreak of genital herpes blisters and sores, these symptoms may come back because the virus lays dormant in your body until it is ‘activated’ by triggers which cause symptoms to appear.Triggers may include:friction on and around your genitals, for example, from tight clothing or sexalcoholsmokingultra-violet light, such as sunbeds or sunbathingbeing illbeing stressedgenital surgeryhormone changes during your menstrual cyclehaving a weakened immune systemTriggers will vary from person to person and it is important to understand what triggers your outbreaks so you can try to avoid them where possible. However, some triggers are unavoidable and there are medications available to help manage outbreaks.What does genital herpes look like? Genital herpes looks like bumps or blisters which are yellow or clear and filled with a clear liquid. It is important to get the correct diagnosis and treatment. If you’re unsure whether you are experiencing genital herpes or another condition, you should get examined by a doctor at a sexual health clinic or your GP.Can genital herpes be mistaken for other conditions?Genital herpes is sometimes mistaken for other conditions such as:STIs that cause visible sores or lesions like genital warts or syphilisa urinary infectionirritation from shaving or ingrown hairsinsect bitespimpleshaemorrhoids (piles)yeast infections",

    "question": "How is genital herpes diagnosed?",
    "answer": "Genital herpes can be diagnosed by taking a swab of a sore or blister and sending it to a lab for testing. You can do this at home, using a genital herpes home test kit or you can visit your local sexual health clinic. This does mean you need to have symptoms at the time of testing. To take an at-home test you just need to rub the swab onto one of your genital blisters or sores, then put it into a test tube and send it to the lab for testing. You will not need to see a doctor. If you get a positive diagnosis, you can then get treatment to manage your symptoms or to prevent further outbreaks.Our swab test kits are just as accurate as those used by doctors at a sexual health clinic and you can order the kit to be delivered straight to your door in discreet packaging, or for collection at your local Post Office. When should you get tested for genital herpes?Get tested right away if you have previously been exposed to genital herpes and think you may be experiencing an outbreak. If you think you might have it but have no symptoms, wait for up to 12 days to take a test. The incubation period (time it takes for the virus to develop in the body) of genital herpes is between 2 to 12 days, but some people exposed to the virus may not experience symptoms for months. You should only take a swab test if you have symptoms. You can speak to your GP about taking a blood test to check for herpes if you had an outbreak and did not get tested at the time you had symptoms. It is important to get tested if you think you may have been exposed to the virus. If genital herpes is left untreated it can cause long-term complications.",

    "question": "How does valaciclovir work?",
    "answer": "Valaciclovir works by stopping the virus from replicating, making it easier for your immune system to get rid of the infection. It does this by stopping an enzyme in the DNA called polymerase from working as it should. This enzyme is essential for the replication of the virus, allowing it to make copies of itself and spread. By stopping the growth of the virus, valaciclovir:helps your immune system control the virusshortens the healing time of genital herpes soresreduces pain lowers the risk of spreading the herpes virusValaciclovir is known as a ‘prodrug’ because once it is inside the body, it is converted into its active form, aciclovir. Valaciclovir is more potent than its active form, so it can be taken less frequently and has a simpler dosing regimen.How long does valaciclovir last?Valaciclovir treatment for genital herpes can last for: 5 to 10 days if it is your first infection 3 to 5 days to treat a recurrent infection (flare-up)In people with normal kidney function, aciclovir, the medication valaciclovir is converted into once inside your body, has a half-life of around 3 hours. Half-life is the time it takes for a medication to reduce by half in your body. How long does valaciclovir take to work?Valaciclovir starts to work as soon as you take the first dose, but you may not notice an improvement in your symptoms for 2 to 3 days. It’s important to get genital herpes treatment as soon as you notice symptoms because antiviral medications like valaciclovir can shorten the duration of your first outbreak by 2 to 4 days, and future outbreaks by around 2 days. How effective is valaciclovir?Valaciclovir is considered an effective genital herpes treatment, reducing transmission of HSV-2 by up to 48% in healthy adults. One study found that 79% of people had no recurrent genital herpes infections while taking valaciclovir compared to 52% of people given a placebo. An earlier study looking at the effectiveness of valaciclovir for reducing genital herpes transmission found that it reduced the risk of transmitting symptomatic genital herpes by 75%, with only 4 out of 743 susceptible partners developing infection compared to 16 out of 741 in a placebo group (group given no medication).",

    "question": "Valaciclovir alternatives",
    "answer": "Valaciclovir is not the only genital herpes treatment available. At ZAVA, we can offer the following alternatives:AciclovirAciclovir is a prescription-only medication that contains the active ingredient aciclovir. The usual dose is one 200mg tablet taken 5 times a day or one 400mg tablet taken 3 times a day. Aciclovir is the active ingredient that valaciclovir is converted to when you take it. FamciclovirFamciclovir is similar to valaciclovir because it's also a prodrug, except it is converted into a different antiviral medication called penciclovir once in the body. It works by preventing the genital herpes virus from replicating and spreading, helping your immune system fight off the infection. The typical dose is one 250mg tablet 3 times a day for 5 days. If you’re not sure if you have genital herpes, you can visit a sexual health clinic or request an at-home genital herpes test kit. To use our at-home test kit, you must have active sores at the time of testing. The kit is supplied with everything you need to take a swab and send your sample back to our partner laboratory. You’ll receive your results within 2 to 3 days of the lab receiving your sample. Valaciclovir vs aciclovirValaciclovir and aciclovir are both antiviral medications that are used to treat herpes simplex virus infections, like genital herpes. The difference is that valaciclovir is a prodrug that is converted into aciclovir in the body. Clinical studies have found that taking valaciclovir 500mg tablets twice a day was as effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of the first genital herpes outbreak as taking aciclovir 200mg tablets 5 times a day.",

    "question": "What are statins?",
    "answer": "Statins are a type of medication used to treat and lower high cholesterol in the blood. There are a few different types of statins but they all work in essentially the same way by blocking an enzyme in the liver that creates what is known as ‘bad cholesterol’ or LDL (low-density lipoprotein). Bad cholesterol causes a plaque which clogs and narrows the arteries, a common cause of heart attacks and strokes.What is high cholesterol?Cholesterol is a natural fatty substance made in the liver and found in the blood that our bodies need to function. There are 2 types of cholesterol: HDL (high density lipoprotein) and LDL (low density lipoprotein). It is high levels of LDL that is considered ‘high cholesterol’ and the medical term is hypercholesterolemia. How common is it?High cholesterol is a very common condition that affects millions of people around the world. In 2021, the Health Survey for England found that the total number of cases of raised cholesterol was higher than in recent years at 56% among men and 61% among women.How it affects your bodyIf left untreated, high cholesterol can be dangerous for your health. It affects the circulatory system and can cause arteries that carry blood around the body to get smaller or become blocked. This restricts blood flow and increases the risk of conditions like:heart diseaseheart attacksstrokesCauses Too much ‘bad’ cholesterol in the blood can be caused by unhealthy diet and lifestyle, for example: not getting enough exerciseeating an unhealthy diet with too much saturated fat smokingHigh cholesterol is also more likely as we age and in general, men are more likely to develop the condition. There is also research to suggest that certain ethnic backgrounds, for example South Asian, may be more likely to develop high cholesterol. High cholesterol can also be caused by genetics (inherited high cholesterol).SymptomsHigh cholesterol can cause symptoms but in most cases there is typically no symptoms of it, therefore many people do not realise they have high cholesterol until they have a blood test. In some cases where high cholesterol is genetic some people may experience visible symptoms like: swollen tendons on the hands, knees or Achilles tendonlight coloured ring around the cornea in the eyeDue to the fact that symptoms for high cholesterol can often be caused by genetics, and that it often doesn’t cause any symptoms at all, it is a condition that needs to be monitored and treated with medication and lifestyle changes.",

    "question": "How do statins work?",
    "answer": "Statins are a class of medications that manage cholesterol levels and prevent heart disease by reducing the amount of ‘bad cholesterol’ or LDL in the blood. They work by blocking the enzyme that the liver uses to make cholesterol.Having high levels of LDL is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (angina, heart disease, heart attack, or stroke) so when levels of LDL are reduced by statins your risk of cardiovascular disease is lowered.There are different types of statins available but most come as tablets to be taken daily, usually at the same time of day. Your dose may vary depending on your cholesterol levels and any other medicines you are prescribed.How effective are statins? Statins are a very effective treatment for the management of high cholesterol levels. They are widely researched and are often the first choice for the treatment of high cholesterol along with diet and lifestyle changes. The effectiveness of statins can differ based on dose and intensity but low and medium intensity statins can reduce LDL cholesterol by 20% to 40%, with high intensity statins able to reduce levels of LDL by greater than 40%.How long does it take for statins to work? Statins start to reduce cholesterol levels after 4 weeks, usually within 6 to 8, depending on the dose and how high your LDL levels are. Statins work best when they are taken consistently long-term, alongside a healthy diet and an active lifestyle.Can high cholesterol levels come back after treatment?If you stop taking statins or if lifestyle factors that cause high cholesterol (poor diet, lack of exercise, and being overweight) get worse while you are on statins, cholesterol levels can increase during or after treatment.Treatment for high cholesterol, once diagnosed, is usually long-term. You will need a repeat supply of prescribed statins and taking the medication as advised is important to maintain lower cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular disease.",

    "question": "What statins are there?",
    "answer": "There are 5 different statins available on prescription in the UK. Most come as tablets to be taken once a day. Most statins work in the same way by reducing the amount of LDL cholesterol produced in the liver to lower your cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.Not all statins are suitable for everyone, so you will be prescribed the best statin for you based on what other medications you take, your cholesterol levels, your general health and medical history. Atorvastatin (Lipitor)What is Atorvastatin and what doses are available?Atorvastatin is an oral tablet to be taken once a day alongside a healthy diet. Generic atorvastatin is available in 4 different strengths: 10mg, 20mg, 40mg, and 80mg while Lipitor is available in 10mg, 20mg, and 40mg tablets.

Research shows it can lower elevated cholesterol levels by 30 to 46% and LDL levels by 41 to 46%. Rosuvastatin (Crestor)What is Rosuvastatin and what doses are available?Rosuvastatin is an oral tablet taken once a day alongside a healthy diet. ZAVA can prescribe rosuvastatin and Crestor (branded rosuvastatin) in 5mg, 10mg, 20mg, and 40mg strength tablets. EffectivenessRosuvastatin works in as little as 1 week, with the maximum effect reached within 4 weeks of taking it. Research shows that those taking a daily 40mg dose after 12 weeks have an average reduction in LDL levels of 53%. Rosuvastatin may be prescribed to those with other health conditions as well as high cholesterol such as:heart diseasediabeteskidney diseaserheumatoid arthritisSimvastatin What is Simvastatin and what doses are available?Simvastatin is an oral tablet to be taken once a day, preferably in the evening. It’s available from ZAVA as a generic treatment in 10mg, 20mg, and 40mg tablets. Your doctor may increase your dose after 4 weeks if your cholesterol levels need further management. EffectivenessSimvastatin takes around 4 weeks to reach its maximum effect. Studies show that it can reduce LDL levels on average by 30 to 47%. It’s often prescribed to those with a family history of heart disease and other health conditions such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. Like all statins, it should be taken alongside a healthy diet. Pravastatin (Lipostat)What is Pravastatin and what doses are available?Pravastatin is also an oral tablet that is taken once a day, preferably in the evening. The recommended doses are 10mg, 20mg, or 40mg and your doctor will increase your dose if you need it. It is usually prescribed to those with a family history of heart disease and other health conditions such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. It should be taken alongside a healthy diet. EffectivenessYour cholesterol levels should lower within 4 weeks on pravastatin or Lipostat (branded pravastatin).

Fluvastatin (Lescol)What is Fluvastatin and what doses are available?Fluvastatin is an oral tablet to be taken once a day alongside a healthy diet. In some cases, it may be prescribed as 40mg twice a day. Fluvastatin can lower high cholesterol and triglycerides (fats) in the blood. It’s available from ZAVA and the recommended doses are 20mg, 40mg, or 80mg. Your doctor will always start you on the lowest dose and increase as needed EffectivenessFluvastatin works quickly and the best effect can be seen after taking it for 4 weeks. After 24 weeks, fluvastatin can lower your LDL levels on average by: 22% (20mg), 25% (40mg), 36% (40mg twice daily), and 35% (80mg). What’s the best treatment for high cholesterol? The ‘best’ treatment for your high cholesterol depends on your personal needs and health. When prescribing a statin, doctors should have a discussion with you and take into consideration factors like: cholesterol levels – are they slightly high or very high?your age – cholesterol and the risk of heart disease increases with ageoverall health – how active is your lifestyle and do you follow a healthy diet?other health conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis can increase the risk of high cholesterol and cardiovascular diseasewhether or not you smoke – smoking can increase LDL/bad cholesterolFrom these factors, doctors can determine your level of risk for cardiovascular disease and determine the appropriate statin strength and dose for you. If you need it, you may be given the maximum dose of your statin.",

    "question": "What are the side effects of statins?",
    "answer": "Like all medications, statins can cause side effects. Many people who take statins will experience little to no side effects, and most side effects are mild in nature. The most commonly reported side effects are muscle aches and pains. Side effects will also vary from statin to statin so make sure to read the patient information leaflet (found in the box with your medication or online).Common side effects Common side effects of statins include: muscle aches and pains headachesdizziness feeling tired or weak low blood platelet countfeeling sick (nausea)trouble sleepingdigestive problems or discomfort, including indigestion, bloating and wind, diarrhoea, or constipationUncommon side effects Uncommon side effects of statins include: being sick (vomiting)forgetfulness/memory problemsincreased risk of type 2 diabetes pins and needles (paresthesia)hepatitis (inflammation of the liver)pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)sexual problems such as a reduced libido (sex drive) or erectile dysfunction in menskin problems such as rashes or acneRare side effects The rare side effects of statins include: muscle pain and weakness (myopathy)muscle damage affecting the kidneys (rhabdomyolysis)tingling or loss of sensation in the nerve endings in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy)problems with tendons (the tissue connecting muscles to bones)serious allergic reaction to the medication, symptoms include breathing difficulties, wheezing, and swelling of the mouth, nose, tongue, or throatSpeak to a doctor straight away if you notice symptoms of any of the rare side effects of statins. Call 999 in an emergency, such as if you have a serious allergic reaction, signs of this include: skin rashes itching hives swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throatdifficulty breathing blue or grey tongue, skin or lips dizziness, confusion and fainting\"While muscle pain is a common side effect of statins, if you experience any severe, unusual muscle pain you should contact your doctor or a healthcare professional immediately as it could be a sign of a serious condition called rhabdomyolysis that can be dangerous if not treated quickly.\" — Dr Brenda Ikeji, Medical EditorHow long do statin side effects last? Any common and mild side effects you experience from statins will wear off or improve after your body gets used to taking the medication, usually within a few weeks. You may also find that you get used to and are able to cope with side effects like muscle aches and pains. Depending on your cholesterol levels, your statin dose may be increased after 4 weeks or more, which could cause or increase side effects.If you do experience side effects that do not improve over time and are unmanageable or severe then you should consult your doctor or prescriber. They may be able to help you switch to a different statin that is a better fit for you or lower your dose. Stopping your statin prescription altogether is not usually recommended because the benefits of the medication for those with high cholesterol at risk of cardiovascular disease often outweigh the discomfort of side effects.What to do if you get side effectsExperiencing side effects on statins is normal especially if you have just started taking them, however, if you are experiencing side effects from statins and this is causing concern you should:1: Manage them at home if you canSide effects like muscle aches and pains, headaches, and nausea are common, mild symptoms that should improve and even go away with time. You can manage these by taking over-the-counter painkillers, using heat pads for muscle aches, and eating food with your statin. 2: Do not stop taking your statinStopping taking your statin can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease. If high cholesterol is not controlled your heart health is at risk. You should always talk to your doctor first if you are considering stopping your statin because of side effects.3: Talk to your doctor or healthcare providerTell your doctor about any side effects you are taking, they will be able to help determine if the side effects you are experiencing are due to the statin or if they are caused by something else. They may also recommend how to manage the side effects, lower your dose or even change which statin you are prescribed.",

    "question": "Are statins suitable for me?",
    "answer": "Statins may not be right for everyone. There are certain conditions and certain medications that can interact with statins that may make them less effective, or potentially unsafe. There are also conditions and medications that may worsen or increase the risk of side effects. Who can’t take statins?Certain conditions mean that you cannot take statins, they include:Liver disease, including reduced liver or kidney function You should not take statins if you have liver disease or if blood tests show that your liver is not working properly. Statins affect processes in the liver so if your liver is already damaged, you may experience more severe side effects.Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or trying to get pregnantIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding you should not take statins and you should stop taking them if you plan to get pregnant. This is because there is not enough evidence to suggest that it is safe to take statins during pregnancy.Who has an increased risk of experiencing side effects? Certain people may have an increased risk of experiencing side effects on statins because of other factors or conditions, including: being over 70 years oldregularly drinking large quantities of alcoholhaving a history of kidney or liver diseasehyperthyroidism having a pre-existing muscle condition, such as fibromyalgiaIf you have any of these risk factors, it’s important to discuss with your healthcare provider before starting a statin.Other medications that interact with statinsCertain medications may make statins less effective or even dangerous to take, so you need to be aware of them. They include: certain medications for HIVamiodaronecyclosporine some antibiotics like itraconazole, clarithromycin, and erythromycinsome antifungals like itraconazole, fluconazole and voriconazole warfarin or other ‘blood-thinners’calcium channel blockers fibratescolchicineBefore prescribing you a statin your doctor should check and assess what other medications you take. If you have any concerns about other medications interacting with statins then make sure to discuss this with your doctor before taking them. If you are on statins but you need to take one of these medicines, your doctor can change your statin, adjust your dose, or advise you about stopping your statin.Food and alcoholConsuming certain things while on statins can make them less effective or even dangerous.Grapefruit juiceDrinking large amounts of grapefruit juice can affect some statins and increase your risk of side effects. It is advised to avoid it completely or only consume small quantities when taking statins.Can you drink alcohol on statins? Drinking large amounts of alcohol can put you more at risk of experiencing more serious side effects of statins, so if you regularly do this you should talk to your doctor. However, drinking some alcohol on statins is okay (under 14 units a week).",

    "question": "How do I know if I need statins?",
    "answer": "Statins are for people diagnosed with high cholesterol, meaning that they have too much LDL (bad) cholesterol. Most people will not know that they need statins until they take a blood test or are told by their doctor that they have high cholesterol as there are often no symptoms.In the UK, high cholesterol levels are considered as follows:High: between 5 and 6.4millimoles per liter (mmol/l)Very high: between 6.5 and 7.8mmol/lExtremely high: above 7.8mmol/lYou may also be prescribed a statin if you're considered at a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, for instance if you: have diabeteshave a family medical history of cardiovascular diseasesmokeare obeseHow do I know if I have high cholesterol?You will need a test to determine whether or not you have high cholesterol. You can request a blood test from your doctor or take an at-home test. You are more likely to have high cholesterol if you are overweight or obese, have a lot of saturated fat in your diet, and if you smoke and drink alcohol.How to test cholesterol levels at homeIt’s possible to check your cholesterol levels at home and you can do this with ZAVA’s easy-to-use cholesterol test kit:Order the test kit online and we’ll deliver it to your home.

    "question": "What other treatment options are there?",
    "answer": "There are some other ways to lower high cholesterol without taking statins. There may be alternative medical options that are suitable for you but the most important options are always lifestyle changes. Lifestyle-based changes1. Change your diet Following a heart-healthy, low-saturated fat diet is key to achieving lower levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol. You can try: adopting a diet that contains more healthy fats and omega-3 fatty acids, such as from oily fish or plant sources like flax and chia seedseating more fibre, such as whole grains and legumes, as this can help you absorb less cholesterolincrease how much fruit and vegetables you eat as these can help you get a range of vitamins, fibre, and nutrientseat more plant stanols and sterols (cholesterol-like compounds naturally found in plant-based foods that can lower LDL levels), by switching to olive or avocado oilavoid foods that are high in saturated fats like fatty meat, butter, lard and ghee, cheeses, and foods containing coconut or palm oilget in the habit of checking packaging or buying ‘reduced fat’ products2. Get more exerciseAim to do 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity such as a brisk walk, cycling or jogging. Regular exercise can help raise HDL and lower LDL.3. Weight lossBeing overweight increases your risk of high cholesterol and cardiovascular disease. Start your weight loss journey to help you lower your cholesterol levels naturally. 4. Quit smoking and limit alcohol consumption Smoking and drinking alcohol can both contribute to high cholesterol levels. Stopping or limiting these can naturally lower high cholesterol. Lifestyle changes are integral to lowering high cholesterol. You should still try to change your diet and exercise habits even while taking statins or other medications.Other prescription medications1.Ezetimibe Ezetimibe is an alternative treatment option to statins if someone is not able to take statins. It can also be used in combination with statins, for example simvastatin.Ezetimibe works to reduce the amount of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood by decreasing how much cholesterol is absorbed from the food you eat in the small intestine. It starts to lower cholesterol within 2 weeks and can reduce LDL by up to 20 to 25%.2.PCSK9 inhibitorsPCSK9 inhibitors work by blocking a protein called PCSK9 which helps the liver to remove more LDL or ‘bad’ cholesterol. They come as an injection taken every 2 to 4 weeks. These treatments are rare and expensive but can be prescribed for high-risk patients. Research suggests that PCSK9 inhibitors can lower LDL cholesterol by up to 60%. However, they are only recommended in cases where a maximum dose of statins has not lowered cholesterol to the desired level or for people who have already experienced a heart attack or stroke.3. Bempedoic acidBempedoic acid is a treatment used to lower high cholesterol that works by reducing cholesterol production in the liver. It’s often considered for statin-intolerant patients and can also be taken in combination with ezetimibe. It is thought to have less risk of side effects like muscle pain than statins.4. FibratesFibrates such as fenofibrate, are prescribed to lower high triglyceride levels, another type of fat in the blood. Fibrates can also help raise levels of HDL (good) cholesterol however, they are not as effective at lowering LDL levels as statins.5. Bile acid sequestrantsBile acid sequestrants work to lower LDL or bad cholesterol by stopping bile acid from the stomach (which contains cholesterol) from being absorbed into the blood. However, they may cause more gastrointestinal discomfort than statins.6. NiacinNiacin is a B vitamin found in certain foods or in supplements. It can be prescribed in high doses to lower high cholesterol. Although it can help, it’s not a popular statin alternative nor prescribed often due to side effects such as liver damage when used for a long time.Home remedies or supplements There is little to no scientific evidence to prove that most home remedies or supplements can help lower high cholesterol. Use these with caution and consult your doctor or a healthcare professional but they may include: berberine, a plant compound that is believed to lower cholesterolpsyllium husk, a supplement and laxative that is a soluble fibre meaning it could help to lower the amount of cholesterol absorbed into the blood",

    "question": "What are the best inhalers for COPD?",
    "answer": "The best inhaler for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) depends on your specific symptoms and the stage of the condition. Inhalers for COPD generally fall into 3 main categories:Short-acting bronchodilators (relievers): Inhalers containing medications like Salbutamol or Ipratropium provide quick relief by relaxing airway muscles. They are often used when symptoms like breathlessness occur suddenly.Long-acting bronchodilators: These are recommended for regular use to manage persistent symptoms. Examples include inhalers containing Formoterol or Tiotropium. They help keep airways open for extended periods.Combination inhalers: These contain a mix of long-acting bronchodilators or a bronchodilator combined with a steroid. They are useful for patients with severe symptoms or frequent flare-ups. Symbicort is a commonly prescribed combination inhaler available through ZAVA.Remember that it’s always important to seek medical advice before trying out different treatments. Your doctor will be able to assess your condition and recommend the most suitable option for you.",

    "answer": "Yes, Symbicort Turbohaler is considered a strong asthma medication because it combines 2 powerful active ingredients: budesonide (a steroid) and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (a long-acting bronchodilator). This dual-action treatment helps manage moderate to severe asthma by reducing inflammation and opening airways, making it effective for patients whose symptoms are not controlled by a steroid-only inhaler.The Symbicort Turbohaler is available in different dosages, including 100/6 mcg and 200/6 mcg. While the 100/6 mcg dose is often prescribed for milder symptoms, the 200/6 mcg provides a stronger steroid dose for patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who need more intensive daily control.Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on the severity of your asthma and your treatment plan. Always follow their instructions and report any changes in your symptoms.",

    "question": "What is type 2 diabetes?",
    "answer": "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition that causes high blood sugar levels, also known as hyperglycaemia. It happens when the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar, or when the body doesn’t use it effectively and becomes resistant (insulin resistant). As a result, glucose builds up in the bloodstream.Over time, type 2 diabetes can harm the kidneys, heart, eyes, and nerves, so it is important to get a prompt diagnosis, monitor your health, and attend regular checkups.Type 2 diabetes can be caused by several factors including genetics, as it can run in families, and lifestyle choices like poor diet or physical inactivity, with an increased risk in people over 40 and certain ethnic groups. Symptoms include:frequent urinationexcessive thirstextreme tiredness or fatigueslow healing woundsweight lossblurred visiongenital itching or recurrent thrushType 2 diabetes is the most common chronic disease in the UK. More than 3.9 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes and 90% of diagnosed adults have the type 2 form. It’s also estimated that around 1 million people are currently undiagnosed and by 2025 more than 5 million people will be diagnosed with diabetes.",

    "question": "Type 2 diabetes tablets",
    "answer": "MetforminMetformin is usually the first-line treatment that’s prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It is available as a tablet and is advised when diet and exercise changes alone haven’t been enough to reduce blood sugar levels. Studies show that metformin reduces the risk of diabetes-related complications and death significantly compared to diet alone.Metformin belongs to a group of medications called biguanides and works by:lowering the amount of sugar your liver releases into your bloodhelping the insulin your body makes to work betterreducing how much sugar is absorbed from the gutBecause of the way it works, metformin improves insulin resistance to stop your blood glucose levels rising too high. Metformin usually starts working within the first week of starting treatment, but it can take up to 12 weeks for you to see the full benefit. Clinical trials show that metformin reduces the risk of diabetes-related:complications from 12.7 events/1,000 patient-years with diet alone to 7.5 events/1,000 patients-yearsdeath from 20.6 events/1,000 patient-years with diet alone to 13.5 events/1,000 patient-yearsMetformin is available as slow-release or standard-release tablets: Slow-release tablets release metformin slowly, so you’ll usually only need to take it once per day. Standard-release tablets release the medication work more quickly and you may need to take them more often during the day. Your doctor will advise which dose and which type of metformin tablets will be most suitable for you. You can request a treatment on ZAVA by filling out a short online questionnaire. If metformin alone is not enough to manage your diabetes or you cannot take it, you may be prescribed other oral medications. SulphonylureasSulphonylureas stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin and they are usually taken once or twice a day with or just before a meal. Sulphonylureas can lower blood sugar levels by around 20% and HbA1c results by 1 to 2% but they can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) and weight gain. In the UK, there are 5 sulphonylureas available. They are:GlibenclamideGliclazideGlimepirideGlipizideTolbutamidePrandial glucose regulators (repaglinide and nateglinide)Prandial glucose regulators are similar to sulphonylureas because they stimulate the pancreas to make more insulin. They work faster than sulphonylureas but their effects only last for a short time. They are available as tablets and should be taken up to 30 minutes before each meal. Prandial glucose regulators include Prandin and Starlix. Thiazolidinediones (glitazones)Glitazones improve your body’s sensitivity to insulin and reduce insulin resistance. They may also protect your pancreatic cells to help them work more effectively. The only glitazone available in the UK is Pioglitazone. It is available in tablet form and research shows that after 2 years Pioglitazone sustained blood sugar control in 69% of patients compared to 50% of patients treated with gliclazide. It is available in 15mg, 30mg or 45mg doses and is taken once per day.Alpha glucosidase inhibitor (Acarbose)Acarbose slows down the digestion of carbohydrates, lowering the rise in blood sugar after eating. It is available as a tablet and the usual starting dose is 50mg, increased to 3 times a day. DPP-4 inhibitors (gliptins)Gliptins enhance the body’s natural production of insulin and lower the production of glucose in the liver by increasing the levels of hormones like GIP and GLP-1. They work in a way that depends on glucose, minimising the risk of hypoglycaemia. They are available as tablets, and a common example is sitagliptin. Research shows that sitagliptin can reduce HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) levels by 0.5% at a dose of 100mg daily over 18 weeks. You’ll need to take it every day and it usually starts to work within a few hours of taking it.SGLT2 inhibitorsThese tablets work by lowering the amount of glucose that’s absorbed by your kidneys and passing the excess out in your urine. You’ll usually take them once a day with or without food. Some SGLT2 inhibitors, like dapagliflozin, can get to work in as little as 2 hours, but it can take up to a week for the full effects to happen. They can reduce HbA1c levels by 7 to 10 mmol/mol compared to a placebo.Common examples of SGLT2 inhibitors include:CanagliflozinDapagliflozinEmpagliflozinErtuglifozin",

    "question": "Type 2 diabetes injections",
    "answer": "InsulinSome people with type 2 diabetes may need to inject insulin to manage their condition. You’ll usually take insulin if the insulin your pancreas makes isn’t working properly (insulin resistance) or your pancreas doesn’t produce enough. There are different types of insulin available, such as:long-acting or intermediate-acting insulin taken once or twice a daylong-acting or intermediate-acting insulin taken once or twice a day and a separate rapid-acting or short-acting insulin taken before a mealmixed or biphasic insulin that contains an intermediate and rapid-acting or short-acting insulin that’s taken 1 to 3 times a day before mealsinsulin pumps, usually inserted via a cannula and delivered throughout the dayEach type of insulin and what is prescribed will vary from person to person, according to which type of diabetes is needed to be treated. A healthcare professional will decide which treatment is most suited to you. Note: You inject insulin yourself using an insulin pen which helps to ensure you inject your medication safely and at the right dose. It’s usually painless and you only inject a small amount under your skin.GLP-1 agonistsAlso known as incretin mimetics, GLP-1 agonists, like Ozempic and Mounjaro, are injectable medications that lower blood glucose levels, increase the amount of insulin when it’s needed, and can stimulate weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients. They are usually self-injected once weekly and are effective medications. Semaglutide (Ozempic) has been shown to lower 2-hour postprandial glucose levels by 37%. Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is also a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonist. For this reason, research shows that tirzepatide causes a greater reduction in blood sugar levels than semaglutide.",

    "answer": "All treatments for type 2 diabetes (injections and tablets) work in different ways, and the administration for them by a healthcare professional varies depending on patient condition, needs and requirements. Generally, type 2 diabetes medications work alongside lifestyle changes to help control blood sugar levels and prevent diabetes-related health problems from occurring. Type 2 diabetes medications work in ways including but not limited to: lowering blood sugar levels reducing glucose absorption (from the intestine) decreasing insulin metabolism in the liver decreasing glucagon secretionincreasing insulin sensitivity Here is further information on type 2 diabetes medications and how they specifically work: TabletsOral medications are often the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes and work in different ways to lower blood sugar levels.

They can also:reduce the amount of sugar your liver makesslow down digestionlower your appetiteInsulin injectionsInsulin is another type of injectable type 2 diabetes treatment that’s usually prescribed if other treatment options haven’t worked. Unlike the other type 2 diabetes injections, insulin is a hormone that works by moving glucose from your bloodstream into the body’s cells, where it is used for energy.How long insulin injections take to work varies depending on the type you are prescribed. For example, most insulins start working within 15 minutes, some take 2 to 4 hours. Intermediate and longer-acting insulin can continue to lower glucose levels for up to 36 hours.What’s the best treatment for type 2 diabetes?The best treatment for type 2 diabetes will depend on several factors including your current health, preferences and any other medications you may be taking. Metformin is the most common type of medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes, which can help to keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy range. You should take metformin, and all other diabetes medications, alongside healthy lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and getting plenty of exercise.

There are many good reasons to stop, which may help you achieve your goal. The most well-known disadvantage of being a smoker is the increased risk of certain types of cancer, such as lung, bladder and larynx cancer. Smoking has a similarly bad impact on your heart and lung health and can lead to a heart attack, blood clots, lung disease and stroke.For many smokers, the health risk is not the only problem associated with their habit. The financial side of being a smoker especially motivates many to quit. If you smoke a pack of cigarettes at a price of £10 everyday, you’ll be spending on average over £300 per month on cigarettes, which amounts to £3,650 per year. For many, this amount equals or exceeds their monthly salary.If you have children or are planning to become a parent in the near future, you have a particularly good reason to give up smoking. Children whose parents smoke have a much higher risk of developing asthma during their childhood and smoking during pregnancy is known to put the baby at risk as it can lead to premature birth. According to a study conducted by the German university of Münster, a baby’s risk of death from sudden infant death syndrome is eight times higher if one or both parents are smokers.",

    "question": "What withdrawal symptoms can occur?",
    "answer": "When you stop smoking, you’ll experience physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms. If you think about situations in which you tend to crave a cigarette, you’ll probably notice a pattern. Knowing which situations trigger your cravings can help you avoid a relapse and develop a personal strategy for not smoking. During the first days of not smoking, ex-smokers tend to be irritable and impatient due to the lack of nicotine.During the withdrawal period, you may find it difficult to concentrate and have trouble sleeping. Some smokers also experience headaches and minor tremors. Usually, these symptoms improve and cease to occur within a week of the last cigarette, however, the intensity and duration of these symptoms differ. The desire to smoke outlasts the physical withdrawal period, which is why some smokers relapse after several months of not smoking.",

    "question": "What can I do to minimise withdrawal symptoms?",
    "answer": "A nicotine replacement therapy can help to reduce withdrawal symptoms, although it will mean that nicotine is still entering your system. The dosage is calculated depending on how many cigarettes you used to smoke and the intake of nicotine is gradually reduced and phased out.Some research suggests that the effectiveness of nicotine therapy has been overestimated in the past. Smokers who took part in a study of the IFT institute for research in Munich were not found to be any more likely to quit permanently when using nicotine products.",

    "question": "How does sport help you to quit smoking?",
    "answer": "Some smokers find it helpful to be physically active while trying to stop smoking. There is evidence which suggests that sport can distract you from your addiction and also help to reduce cravings during the withdrawal period.In a recent study conducted by the University of Exeter, smokers who had not consumed any nicotine for 15 hours reported a reduced desire to smoke after sport than physically inactive participants. The exact link between sport and smoking is unknown but experts believe that the release of dopamine during exercise has a positive impact. In addition, sport helps prevent the weight-gain some smokers experience after giving up.",

    "question": "What medications are available to help you quit smoking?",
    "answer": "ZybanZyban is a medication that helps to minimise smoking withdrawal symptoms and cravings. It works by affecting the part of your brain associated with addiction and cravings. Zyban is effective in minimising the enjoyment of smoking if you smoke during treatment. It was originally used to treat depression. Zyban contains the active ingredient bupropion hydrochloride.CytisineCytisine has recently been released in the UK for quitting smoking and is available as a prescription medication. The brand name and active ingredient are the same: Cytisine. This medication works like Champix, reducing the urge to smoke by attaching itself to the receptors in the brain that nicotine usually would. Cytisine is taken as a 25-day course on the first day you quit. Each Cytisine tablet contains 1.5 mg and each pack contains 100 tablets, which makes a complete treatment course. You’ll follow a treatment plan while taking Cytisine, which means slowly decreasing the amount of tablets you take. On days 1 to 3, you’ll take up to 6 tablets a day, with 2 hours between doses. By the time you get to the final few days, you’ll be taking 1 or 2 tablets a day. This can reduce the cravings and urges that you usually get, making it easier to quit for good. ChampixChampix is currently out of stock long-term. Consider Zyban or Cytisine treatment instead.Champix contains the active ingredient Varenicline and is free from nicotine. When you smoke a cigarette, areas of the brain are stimulated by nicotine, which releases dopamine. This leads to a feeling of well-being and relaxation, which smokers enjoy.Champix occupies these receptors and prevents the intake of nicotine, as well as its effect. At the same time, Varenicline reduces withdrawal symptoms and minimises the cravings. It helps smokers to stop consuming nicotine and makes it easier to stop smoking permanently.According to a study carried out by the pharmaceutical manufacturer Pfizer, Champix increases your chances of quitting significantly. 23% of the participants of the study who were taking Champix were still non-smokers 40 weeks after their last cigarette. In comparison, only 9% of participants who were given a placebo had managed not to relapse.",

    "question": "How does varenicline work?",
    "answer": "Varenicline works by reducing the cravings and the severity of the withdrawal symptoms you might experience when you quit smoking. Varenicline reduces cravings for nicotine by binding to the same receptors in the brain that nicotine does. By binding to these receptors, varenicline prevents nicotine binding to them and stimulates the release of a small amount of dopamine, the same chemical that reinforces and rewards smoking. How long does varenicline take to work?Varenicline starts working within 1 to 2 weeks after starting treatment, and you may notice that you start to crave cigarettes less than you did. Even if you don’t feel any effects within the first two weeks, you should continue with your treatment, as it can take a little longer to start working for some people.How effective is varenicline?Clinical trials have compared the effects of varenicline with another smoking cessation medication, bupropion. The results found that after 4 weeks 44.4% of people using varenicline had stopped smoking compared to 29.5% for bupropion and 17.7% for placebo.Further research assessed the benefit of a further 12 weeks treatment with varenicline to continue helping people stop smoking. The results found that:70% of people were still not smoking between weeks 13 and 24 compared to 49.8% given a placebo 44% had still quit smoking between weeks 13 and 52 compared to 37.1% using a placebo Another study shows that varenicline can help 45.5% of people quit smoking compared to 38.2% for bupropion, 33% for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and 4.2% for psychosocial support. All of these trials show that varenicline has higher success rates compared to other smoking cessation medications.",

Before you start taking varenicline, decide on the day during the second week of treatment that you are going to stop smoking. Once decided:Take one 0.5mg tablet each day on days 1 to 3.Then, take one 0.5mg tablet twice a day from days 4 to 7.After your first week of treatment, take 1mg twice a day for the remaining 11 weeks.

During your second week, stop smoking on your decided day and continue with your treatment. Each varenicline tablet should be swallowed whole with a glass of water and can be taken with or without food. From day 4 onwards, you should take varenicline once in the morning and then once in the evening, according to your current dose.Varenicline dosageThe usual varenicline dosage is:Days 1 to 3 – 500mcg (0.5mg) once per dayDays 4 to 7 – 500mcg (0.5mg) twice per dayDay 8 onwards – 1mg twice a dayIf you cannot tolerate the higher dose of varenicline (1mg twice a day), then your doctor may lower the dose to 500mcg twice a day.

    "question": "What are the symptoms of cold sores?",
    "answer": "The main symptom is the sores themselves. Cold sores usually affect the mouth and lips, and they can take up to 20 days to develop after you have been infected. The sore usually appears close to where the virus entered your body. A cold sore usually starts with a burning, itching, or tingling feeling. Then, over the next 48 hours, 1 or more blisters will appear on your face.These blisters will break open and some fluid may ooze out of them, lasting 2 to 3 days. A scab will then form over the sore, which may crack and bleed. The scab should fall off and the cold sore will be healed within 10 to 14 days.",

    "question": "What causes cold sores?",
    "answer": "Cold sores are usually caused by an infection of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). HSV-1 is the most common cause of oral herpes (cold sores) and is a member of the same family as HSV-2, the most common cause of genital herpes. However, both types of herpes simplex virus can cause sores on the face or genitals. Most people are infected with HSV-1 during childhood through close skin-to-skin contact with an infected person.Once you are exposed to the virus, it remains in your skin for the rest of your life. In many cases, it lies dormant and causes no symptoms, but certain triggers can reactivate it, resulting in cold sore outbreaks. When is a cold sore contagious?Cold sores are contagious from the moment you notice the first tingling, burning, or itching sensations, including before a blister appears, until the cold sore has completely healed and the scab has fallen off.To stop you from passing on the infection, you should avoid:touching the cold sore – always wash your hands with soap and water if you dooral sexkissingIf you pass a cold sore onto a baby, it can cause neonatal herpes, which can be a serious condition. Although it’s rare for HSV to be passed on from things like sharing towels or drinking from the same cup, it’s best to avoid sharing objects that touch your mouth while you have a cold sore.Cold sore triggersCertain things can trigger a cold sore outbreak, such as:stressfatigueillnesssunlight exposurehormonal fluctuations or being on your periodIf you know what triggers your cold sore outbreaks, it can make it easier for you to avoid them in the future. Following a healthy, balanced lifestyle can also lower your risk of outbreaks. However, some people may never know what their triggers are. Keeping a diary is a useful way to help you track your triggers, record the severity of the outbreak, and which treatments, if any, work for you.",

    "question": "How to treat cold sores",
    "answer": "Although there is no cure for HSV or cold sores, there are things you can do to treat outbreaks and manage the symptoms. Treatment for an uncomplicated cold sore isn’t always needed, but it can help to speed up the healing process and improve your symptoms. Cold sore treatments are available as tablets and creams, and can be used as soon as you start to notice the tingling, itching, or burning sensation. Common cold sore treatmentsCold sore creamCold sore cream (aciclovir cream) contains the active ingredient aciclovir and is also available under the brand name Zovirax. It’s applied topically, to the infected area. Aciclovir stops HSV multiplying, reducing the severity and duration of your cold sore symptoms. In studies, aciclovir cream was found to reduce healing time and pain duration by 0.4 days compared to a placebo cream. You can get cold sore cream over the counter. Cold sore treatment patchesCold sore treatment patches are a topical patch applied to the infected area, such as Compeed. They contain the active ingredient hydrocolloid gel and work by creating a moist, protective environment that promotes healing by absorbing excess fluid and preventing scabbing. Research shows they are as effective as aciclovir 5% cream for cold sore wound healing and are available over the counter. Aciclovir tabletsAciclovir tablets contain aciclovir and are taken by mouth. Aciclovir is an antiviral medication that stops the herpes virus growing and spreading, so your immune system can deal with the infection. Research shows that aciclovir tablets can make cold sore symptoms go away 1 day earlier in otherwise healthy people. You’ll need a prescription to get aciclovir in tablet form. Valaciclovir tablets Valaciclovir is a generic medication that comes in the form of tablets that you swallow whole. In the body valaciclovir is converted into aciclovir, which stops the herpes virus multiplying, relieves pain, heals sores, and helps the immune system deal with the infection.Research shows it can shorten initial outbreaks by 2 to 4 days and recurrent outbreaks by 2 days. Valaciclovir tablets are prescription-only. ➤ At ZAVA, we offer aciclovir tablets or valaciclovir tablets to treat cold sores or to prevent future outbreaks. If you’re not sure if your symptoms are being caused by a cold sore, order a cold sore test kit for a fast and effective diagnosis. What’s the best cold sore treatment?Antiviral treatments like aciclovir or valaciclovir are both effective first-line treatments for cold sores. If you experience recurrent cold sore outbreaks, a doctor may prescribe aciclovir tablets to suppress the infection and prevent future outbreaks. Aciclovir is available in topical cream or oral tablet form, and which is best for you will depend on several factors.Most cold sores will clear up on their own within 10 days, so you don’t need to get treatment, but it can help you manage your symptoms and get rid of them faster.",

    "question": "What is a migraine?",
    "answer": "A migraine is a severe headache that usually causes a throbbing or pulsing pain on one side of your head. Approximately 10 million people in the UK live with migraine, with 3 million workdays being lost each year to migraine-related illness. Migraines are debilitating and can interfere with your usual daily routine, and cause other symptoms as well as a bad headache, such as feeling or being sick, and sensitivity to light. Although there’s currently no cure for migraine, effective treatments are available that can reduce the frequency, severity, and length of migraine attacks. Types of migraineMigraines are broadly classified as with or without aura, but there are several subtypes.Some of the common migraine types are:1. Migraine without aura (common migraine) – The most common migraine type that causes a severe headache, usually on 1 side of the head. Sometimes causes other symptoms like feeling and being sick, and sensitivity to light and sound.2. Migraine with aura (classic migraine) – Usually has warning signs just before the migraine starts, known as aura. This may include: seeing zigzag linesnumbness or tinglingdizzinessdifficulty speaking3. Migraine aura without headache (silent migraine) – Some people experience aura (the warning signs of a migraine) but don’t get the headache.Other migraine subtypes include:migraine with brainstem aura – some people experience neurological symptoms, including vertigo, double vision, slurred speech, ringing in their ears, or fainting before a migrainehemiplegic migraine – a rare but severe form of migraine that causes temporary paralysis or weakness on 1 side of the body that can last daysmenstrual migraine – these affect women and usually start a few days before your period and can last for a few days afterwardschronic migraine – defined as having a headache on at least 15 days of the month, and affects around 2 in 100 peopleabdominal migraine – more common in children and causes abdominal symptoms like stomach pain and feeling or being sick, with or without headacheretinal migraine – a migraine that affects the eyes, causing temporary vision loss in 1 eyevestibular migraine – a migraine that causes vertigo, dizziness, or balance issues",

So, if someone in your family has a history of migraines, you may be more likely to develop them yourself, although it’s not guaranteed. Scientists and doctors agree that they result from abnormal brain activity that affects the brain's nerve signals, chemicals, and blood vessels. Certain genes may be linked to this abnormal brain activity.Several factors can trigger migraine attacks or increase your risk of having one. These triggers can vary from person to person, but include:anxiety and depressionstresstirednessstarting a period or other hormonal changesskipping meals or not eating regularlyconsuming too much caffeinenot getting enough exercisecertain medicationsweather or environmental changesstrong smells",

    "question": "How to get rid of a migraine",
    "answer": "There is no cure for migraines, but there are treatments available to help you manage the symptoms. Many people find that certain triggers bring on a migraine attack. Identifying what causes or worsens your migraines can help you reduce their frequency. Over-the-counter painkillers are the first-line treatment to help deal with migraine effects, but if they do not work for you, a doctor may prescribe other medications. These can be taken to prevent or manage migraine symptoms.Preventive medications are usually taken every day to help stop migraines from occurring. These are prescribed if:you get migraines frequently (more than once a week)your migraines are so severe that they impact your daily life, even if you’re taking migraine medicationsPrescription migraine treatmentsPrescription migraine treatments include:1. Triptans Also known as serotonin receptor agonists, they target serotonin receptors in the brain. The brain’s blood vessels can widen during a migraine, causing migraine symptoms, but triptans narrow the blood vessels to help relieve the headache.2. Anti-sickness medication Examples include prochlorperazine, which works by blocking the dopamine receptors in the brain to reduce nausea and vomiting during a migraine.3. Gepants A newer type of migraine treatment that is suitable for people with heart-related conditions because they do not narrow blood vessels. They may also cause fewer side effects than triptans, have a longer-lasting effect, and may work even if you’ve tried triptans and they did not have an effect. Some gepants can also be used to prevent migraines. Gepants are calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, which means they block CGRP from attaching to its receptors. CGRP is a substance released during a migraine attack, and while it’s not the main cause of migraines, it’s been found to play a big role in the development and severity of migraine attacks.At ZAVA, we can provide the following migraine treatments following a consultation with one of our doctors:",

    "answer": "There are a variety of different weight loss treatments, such as weight loss injections and weight loss tablets, that are licensed and approved for use in the UK. These treatments work best when taken alongside a healthy diet and exercise plan, so you can lose weight effectively and safely.Weight loss medications can only be prescribed at ZAVA if you have a body mass index (BMI) over 30, or if you have a BMI of 27 to 30, with one or more weight-related health conditions. Some examples of weight-related medical conditions include prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease.Weight loss medications are split into two categories: weight loss injections and weight loss tablets.Weight loss injectionsWeight loss injections help you lose weight by reducing your appetite and helping you feel fuller after a meal. This means you’ll be more satisfied after a meal with fewer calories. Weight loss injections are the most effective weight loss treatment for most people, and can help you lose up to 22.5% of your starting body weight (statistic taken from a study on Mounjaro 15mg taken once a week for 72 weeks).Weight loss injections come as pens that you inject yourself with at home, so you do not need a medical professional to inject them for you. You usually inject yourself in the stomach, thigh, or upper arm (with help) – wherever is most comfortable for you.Mounjaro (tirzepatide) is an injectable weight loss treatment. It contains the active ingredient tirzepatide which mimics 2 naturally occurring hormones in your body called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). They both help your body control your appetite and how full you feel. Mounjaro helps you lose weight by reducing hunger and prolonging how satisfied you feel after a meal.Wegovy (semaglutide) is a weight loss injection that contains the active ingredient semaglutide, which acts like GLP-1. Usually, after you have eaten a meal, your intestines release GLP-1 to tell your brain that you have eaten. Wegovy works the same way and sends signals to your brain that you are full, so you can eat less and reduce your weight. Like Mounjaro, it also increases feelings of fullness after a meal.Liraglutide (generic Saxenda) is another injection for people to help them lose weight. It contains a different ingredient also mimicking GLP-1, called liraglutide. Like Wegovy and Mounjaro, liraglutide tells your brain you’re full, making it easier to eat less and lose weight with diet and exercise. It is injected once a day. Saxenda contains the active ingredient liraglutide but is currently long-term out of stock. However, generic liraglutide injections will soon be available. Weight loss tabletsWeight loss tablets help you lose weight in one of two ways: by reducing how much fat your body absorbs from food (orlistat and Xenical) or suppressing your appetite (Mysimba). Weight loss tablets are less effective than weight loss injections according to studies, but may be a good option if you are uncomfortable with injections.Orlistat and Xenical contain the active ingredient orlistat. When taken with a meal that contains fat, it attaches to the enzymes in your digestive system, called lipase. Orlistat blocks lipase from breaking down fat in your food and absorbing it. This means some of the fat from your meal will turn into waste and be eliminated from your body as stool. alli is an over-the-counter weight loss tablet that also contains orlistat, but at a lower dose of 60mg.Mysimba works differently than orlistat. Instead of having an effect on the digestive system, it works on the areas of your brain that control energy levels and food intake. This can reduce your appetite so that you feel fuller when you eat less. The combination of the 2 active ingredients in Mysimba can also control the pleasure you get from eating, reducing food cravings.When you take any weight loss treatment, our doctors will review your weight regularly and make sure it is working as it should. Any weight loss medication must be taken alongside a healthy diet plan and regular exercise. Here at ZAVA, we send out a doctor and in-house nutritionist weight loss support pack with your first weight loss medication order. You can also access doctor advice for free through your patient account.",

    "question": "Weight loss injections vs weight loss tablets  Weight loss injections  Weight loss tablets",
    "answer": "When choosing which weight loss treatment is right for you, it's important to consider: whether you'd prefer taking tablets or using an injectable pen whether you will remember to take a daily injection like liraglutide, or you'd find it easier taking a once-weekly injection like Wegovy or Mounjaro your current BMI, as this will determine which medications you are suitable for how you want your weight loss medication to work: reducing appetite (Mounjaro, Wegovy, liraglutide, and Mysimba) vs reducing how much fat you absorb (orlistat products) your budget how much weight you want ot lose, as some medications have been proven to show a larger percentage of weight loss than others \"It's important to read about each weight loss medication and how they work to see which you’d prefer. Your doctor will also check your medical history and make sure your chosen treatment is suitable, or offer an alternative if possible. Weight loss injections often cause more weight loss in clinical trials, however, all weight loss medications can be effective when taken alongside a reduced-calorie, balanced diet, and enough exercise.” - Dr Brenda Ikeji ➤ Need some help? Complete a short medical questionnaire and get a weight loss treatment recommendation Weight loss injections vs weight loss tablets Here are some pros and cons of each treatment which may help you make up your mind. Weight loss injections ✔ Weight loss injections have been proven in clinical trials to cause a larger percentage of weight loss with Mounjaro users losing up to 22.5% of their weight after taking the 15mg maintenance dose for 72 weeks. Meanwhile people using Mysimba lost an average of 8.1% of their weight after 56 weeks. ✔ Weight loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro are only taken once a week , rather than weight loss tablets like orlistat or Mysimba which are taken more than once a day. Liraglutide is the exception here, as it’s a weight loss injection taken once a day. ✔ Weight loss injections all work by reducing your appetite, which can be helpful for people who struggle with calorie reduction and cravings. Mysimba weight loss tablets do work in a similar way while orlistat only works if you eat fat with each meal. Weight loss tablets ✔ Not everybody is comfortable taking an injection, so tablets may be a better choice if you cannot put up with injections . However, it’s important to note that weight loss injections come in the form of a self-injectable pen much like an insulin pen, and the needles you use are small. You can also get someone to help you. ✔ Most weight loss medications require a prescription but alli (over-the-counter orlistat) does not. You’ll just need to answer some questions from your pharmacist before getting it, as it’s unsuitable for some people. ✔ Weight loss tablets usually cost less than weight loss injections, with alli prices starting from £39.50 and orlistat starting from £49.99 at ZAVA. However, weight loss injections may help you lose more weight, so you may need to take tablets for longer to get the same results.",

    "question": "How do weight loss injections work?How do weight loss tablets work?",
    "answer": "Each prescription weight loss medication works in a slightly different way, as they contain different active ingredients. Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda, generic liraglutide and Mysimba all work on the brain and other organs, to reduce appetite levels and cravings, making it easier to eat less and lose weight.Orlistat, alli, and Xenical work by changing how your body digests fat. alli is actually an over-the-counter weight loss pill, but a doctor or pharmacist still needs to check your BMI and medical history to make sure it’s suitable.How do weight loss injections work?Weight loss injections work similarly because they all belong to a class of medications called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists. This means they mimic GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone that:reduces appetite, helping you to eat lessdelays the emptying of your stomach, helping you to stay fuller between mealsregulates your blood sugar levels which can help manage diabetes (if you have it) and reduces food cravings Mounjaro also mimics a second hormone called glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). This is thought to enhance the effects of GLP-1 while improving how your body breaks down sugar and fat. How do weight loss tablets work?Orlistat (Xenical, alli) is a type of medication called a lipase inhibitor. This means when you eat a meal containing fat it blocks the absorption of about a third of it, and instead, this is excreted from your body in your stools. It’s recommended to take orlistat 3 times a day and consume about 30% of your daily calories in the form of healthy fats, split evenly across each of these 3 meals. Mysimba contains 2 active ingredients called naltrexone and bupropion. They are usually used to treat different conditions but when taken together work on the parts of your brain that control appetite, reducing hunger and the desire to snack.",

    "answer": "Weight loss treatment can have side effects, just like any other medication. Not everyone will get them, and if they do appear, they usually only last for a few weeks, though they could come back after increasing your dose. If you get side effects whilst taking weight loss treatment and they do not go away or bother you a lot, you can speak to our doctors.Some treatments are increased gradually over time, like Wegovy, Mounjaro, liraglutide, and Mysimba, to reduce the chances of side effects.

    "question": "How to get weight loss medicationCan you buy weight loss medication online?Can you get weight loss medication on the NHS?Can you get weight loss medication over the counter?",
    "answer": "You can get weight loss medication prescribed online from safe and regulated sites like ZAVA. Some weight loss medications are available on the NHS and alli (containing 60mg of orlistat) is available over the counter at most pharmacies. Can you buy weight loss medication online?Yes, you can get weight loss medication prescribed quickly and safely online through regulated services like ZAVA Online Doctor. You can request weight loss treatment today by completing a short online form. This will ask about your current health and any relevant conditions or medications that could affect your suitability for treatment. If it’s your first order or you haven’t ordered in a while, we’ll also need you to send some photos that show your current weight. This allows us to safely prescribe weight loss medications without face-to-face appointments. Once you’ve sent in your form and photos, a doctor will check your suitability and prescribe your treatment or recommend one for you. Your treatment will then be delivered straight to your door via your chosen delivery method.Repeat prescriptions, doctor check-ins, weight loss advice and support, and more are available in your patient account for free. Can you get weight loss medication on the NHS?Yes, you can get weight loss medication on the NHS although most treatments need to be prescribed by a weight loss specialist who you need to be referred to. You must meet the criteria for a weight management service to be referred, and this can take anywhere from a few months to a few years as demand is high. Some GPs and pharmacists are receiving training on prescribing weight loss medications, however, this will not be a nationwide standard for some time. Weight loss injectionsWeight loss injections on the NHS are prescribed under different criteria than private doctor services like ZAVA. For instance, you can usually get Wegovy on the NHS if you have a BMI of at least 30 and a health condition that is affected by your weight. We can prescribe Wegovy if you have a BMI over 30, even if you do not have a weight-related health condition. This could mean Wegovy is still accessible for you even if you cannot get it on the NHS. After being reviewed by NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), Mounjaro has been accepted as a weight loss injection on the NHS and is to be rolled out in phases over the next few years, starting in 2025. People in the highest risk categories for serious illness due to weight-related conditions will be first to receive the injection on the NHS, such as those who have: an initial BMI of at least 35at least 1 weight-related comorbidityLiraglutide is available through the NHS depending on availability from manufacturers. Weight loss tabletsMysimba can only be prescribed privately and is not available on the NHS. Orlistat is the only weight loss medication that can be prescribed by any GP, and you can get alli over the counter. If you want to try weight loss treatment on the NHS it’s best to speak to your GP and find out what is available in your area and the current waiting times.Can you get weight loss medication over the counter?The only weight loss medication available over the counter is alli, which contains orlistat but at a lower dose of 60 mg per tablet. That being said, you can only take weight loss medication if you meet certain conditions and some treatments cannot be taken if you take other medications or have certain health conditions.So, even if you want to take alli, a pharmacist or doctor will need to check your medical history and BMI first. Our doctors will make sure it is safe to take any weight loss medication before you are prescribed it.You may be able to get some weight loss supplements over the counter, but they won’t contain an active ingredient that is proven to support weight loss.",

    "question": "DietExerciseSurgery",
    "answer": "Alongside medication, you can support your weight loss journey with options like healthy eating and regular exercise. Surgery is sometimes considered when other weight loss methods haven’t worked and should generally be a last resort.DietTo lose weight at a safe pace of 0.5 to 1 kg a week, you should reduce your calorie intake by 600 kcal a day. Your doctor will help you with a diet plan if you need it.

Men should be eating no more than 1,900 calories daily. To lose weight, you should swap high-energy and unhealthy foods for healthier choices. This means lowering your intake of processed food, fast food, and sugary drinks like sodas and alcohol.ExerciseAlthough a healthy and balanced diet can help you to lose weight, you also need to burn energy through regular exercise.

    "answer": "You can follow this step-by-step guide on how to inject liraglutide:Make sure your medication is clear and colourless. If it is cloudy or has a colour, then you should not use that dose.Pull off the protective pen cap concealing the needle.

The best place to inject liraglutide is your stomach, though you should inject it into a different part of your stomach, arm, or thigh every time to prevent bruising or other irritation.

This helps to regulate the amount of liraglutide in your system across the day, making it more effective in helping you lose weight.

    "question": "Weight loss injectionsWeight loss tablets",
    "answer": "While liraglutide is a highly effective weight loss medication, it may not be right for everyone. However, there are other options which may be better for you.Weight loss injectionsWegovy – Wegovy is a weight loss injection that contains the active ingredient semaglutide. You take it once a week, and it works similarly to liraglutide, by reducing your appetite so you feel fuller after a meal. Mounjaro – Mounjaro is a prescription weight loss injection that contains the active ingredient tirzepatide. You take it once a week. It has only recently been approved for use in the UK for weight loss. It also works by reducing appetite, so you eat fewer calories. Studies have shown Mounjaro to be the most effective weight loss injection, helping those who use it lose up to 22.5% of their starting body weight.Weight loss tabletsXenical – Xenical is a weight loss tablet that contains the active ingredient orlistat, and is manufactured by Roche. This medication reduces the amount of fat your body absorbs from food, which is passed out through your body as stool. Xenical tablets are less effective than liraglutide injections, but may be a good alternative for those who would prefer swallowing a tablet instead of a daily injection.Orlistat – Orlistat is an unbranded version of Xenical, which means it is available at a lower price. It works in the exact same way as Xenical, and is just as effective.Mysimba – Mysimba is a weight loss tablet that contains the active ingredients naltrexone hydrochloride and bupropion hydrochloride. It also works by reducing your appetite, similar to weight loss injections.alli – alli is a branded version of orlistat that is available over-the-counter, so you can get it from a pharmacy without needing a prescription. alli is only available at a dose of 60mg, which is the lowest dose of orlistat for weight loss.",

    "answer": "Is liraglutide the same as Saxenda?Yes, liraglutide is a newly available generic version of Saxenda. Saxenda is a branded medication that can only be manufactured by Novo Nordisk. Because liraglutide is a generic medication, it can be manufactured by other pharmaceutical companies, which means it is available at a lower price. Liraglutide works exactly the same way as Saxenda, and is just as effective in helping you lose weight.Can I switch from Saxenda to liraglutide?Yes, you can switch from Saxenda to liraglutide as they are effectively the same medication. Simply speak to your doctor, and they will be able to prescribe liraglutide instead of Saxenda, usually at a lower cost.Can I switch from Wegovy to liraglutide?Yes, you can switch from Wegovy to liraglutide. These 2 medications work similarly to help you lose weight, so if you have tried Wegovy and found it does not work for you, then liraglutide could be a good alternative. You will need to speak to your doctor first to make sure that there are no health risks, and you will need to stop taking Wegovy for a month before you can start using liraglutide.Can I switch from Mounjaro to liraglutide?Yes, you can switch from Mounjaro to liraglutide, but you should only do this under the supervision of your doctor. You will need to wait at least 5 weeks before you can start taking liraglutide after your last dose of Mounjaro to make sure tirzepatide has left your system. After 5 weeks, you will need to start on the lowest dose of liraglutide (0.6mg daily) before gradually increasing over 5 weeks until you reach 3mg, the maximum maintenance dose. What happens if I stop taking liraglutide?There are no withdrawal symptoms associated with abruptly stopping liraglutide, but you may notice that your appetite returns because its appetite suppression effects will no longer work. Research has shown that after 12 months of stopping liraglutide, 19% of people regained 100% of the weight they previously lost. This is why combining weight loss medications, like liraglutide, with a healthy diet and exercise plan is recommended because it can lead to better weight maintenance, even after the medication is stopped, if these healthy lifestyle habits are continued.Can I drink alcohol when taking liraglutide?Yes, while there are no known interactions between liraglutide and alcohol, it’s best to limit or avoid alcohol while taking it. Alcohol can make side effects like nausea worse and adds empty calories, which may limit your weight loss efforts. If you are going to drink alcohol while taking liraglutide, it is best to do so in moderation and avoid drinking on an empty stomach, as this can increase the chance of low blood sugar levels.Does liraglutide need to be refrigerated?Yes, before opening your liraglutide pen, it must be stored in a fridge between 2 and 8°C. Do not freeze the pen and make sure it is kept away from any freezer compartment in your fridge. Once your pen has been opened, you can store it for 1 month at a temperature below 30°C or in a fridge between 2 and 8°C. If you are unsure about how to store liraglutide, speak to your doctor or pharmacist for further advice. Is liraglutide safe for long-term use?Yes, liraglutide is generally considered safe for long-term use. Your doctor will review your medication after 3 months. If you have lost at least 5% of your body weight, they will usually recommend that you continue taking it. Studies have shown that body weight improvements are maintained after 2 years of liraglutide treatment.",

It’s not fully known how it does this, however, bupropion and naltrexone are usually prescribed to help people quit an addiction, such as smoking or drinking alcohol, so it’s thought that it works in a similar way to reduce food cravings instead. Mysimba can help people eat less and lose weight by reducing feelings of hunger and increasing feelings of fullness after eating less food.",

    "question": "Glucomannan",
    "answer": "What is it?Glucomannan is a food supplement made of natural fibre from the Konjac plant. How does it work?It should be taken with plenty of water because it absorbs water and expands in the stomach. This can result in feelings of fullness and therefore reduce the appetite. For some people, glucomannan may be a viable appetite suppressant but its results differ from person to person. Several controlled clinical trials have concluded that glucomannan intake does not result in statistically significant weight loss but note that more rigorous trials are still needed.",

    "answer": "What is it?Green tea is a type of tea leaf made from the leaves and buds of a plant called Camellia sinensis. It’s often found as loose tea, ready-made tea bags, or supplements containing green tea extract.How does it work?Green tea is thought to have properties which may speed up the metabolism and increase fat burning. One study found that green tea extract (EGCG) can delay gastric emptying to a small but statistically significant amount, which could help to reduce appetite. If your stomach empties more slowly you will feel fuller for longer and may be less likely to overeat or snack. Although these effects are modest, green tea extract is a healthy option you could use during your weight loss journey.",

    "answer": "What is it?Apple cider vinegar is a type of vinegar made from cider. It’s used in food and supplements. How does it work?Apple cider vinegar might help to indirectly suppress the appetite by regulating blood sugar levels and reducing cravings. There is little evidence to suggest that ACV is an effective appetite suppressant but it is nonetheless good for our gut’s healthy bacteria and digestion. However, vinegar can cause or increase stomach issues, such as indigestion and acid reflux, especially if taken on an empty stomach.",

    "question": "How long does Orlos last?How long does Orlos take to work?How effective is Orlos?",
    "answer": "Orlos contains 60mg of orlistat, which is a lipase inhibitor that stops the lipase enzyme from digesting fat and storing it in your body. This prevents your body from absorbing about 30% of fat from food that you eat. The fat is instead passed out of your stool waste when you go to the toilet.This helps you to lose weight as you absorb less fat from the food you eat so have a lower calorie intake. Orlos should be taken while following a diet and exercise plan to make sure the calories you are eating contain low amounts of fat and more healthy, balanced meals. If you eat too much fat with Orlos, you aren’t likely to see much of a weight change as it doesn’t prevent the absorption of all dietary fat.Studies show that Orlos supports weight loss journeys as it helps patients adjust to the changes necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle.How long does Orlos last?You need to take Orlos 3 times a day, once with water with each meal and it lasts to absorb the fat you take in from your meals. After taking Orlos, it will stay in your digestive system for 6 hours. If you decide to stop taking Orlos, it will be in your digestive system for 72 hours.How long does Orlos take to work?The active ingredient orlistat begins to work in as little as 24 to 48 hours after taking it. If you take Orlos as prescribed (with meals that contain fat), it will begin to work instantly. However, this does not mean you will see results right away. You should lose some weight gradually, after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment, and at least 5% after 3 months.How effective is Orlos?In clinical studies, almost 50% of patients reported a 5% weight loss within just the first 6 months of treatment of taking 60mg orlistat (Orlos).Each patient sees different results depending on their circumstances. It is important that you take Orlos as instructed by a pharmacist, and maintain a balanced diet and exercise whilst taking the medication. The medication will not be effective if you do not take it with meals containing fat.If you take Orlos and do not see results within 12 weeks, your pharmacist may recommend an alternative weight loss treatment.",

If you do not eat a meal that contains fat, you do not need to take Orlos.How much Orlos to take (dosage)Each tablet of Orlos contains 60 mg of orlistat, which is the recommended dosage for this medication. You should only take one tablet of Orlos with each meal that contains fat, up to 3 times a day. The maximum amount of Orlos you should take a day is 3 tablets, or 180mg.How long do you need to take Orlos forYou should start seeing noticeable weight loss results within 2 to 3 weeks of taking Orlos, but it will take 1 to 3 months to see the full effect.Orlos is widely taken as a supplement alongside a balanced diet and exercise, helping to facilitate your adjustment to new lifestyle changes that are beneficial to your weight loss journey. This means that you should lose weight gradually when taking Orlos.Each patient reacts to treatment differently, and some people may not see the results they want with Orlos.

    "question": "Orlos vs alliOrlos vs orlistat vs XenicalOrlos vs MysimbaOrlos vs weight loss injections",
    "answer": "If you do not think that Orlos is the right treatment for your weight loss journey, we offer a range of alternatives at ZAVA online doctor, such as (but not limited to):XenicalMysimbaMounjaroWegovyBelow we compare these alternatives to Orlos, so you can decide what might be right for you:Orlos vs alliOrlos is the generic version of alli. This means there is no difference between the two treatments apart from the price and brand. Both Orlos and alli can help you lose around 50% more weight than you would if you only dieted alone.Orlos vs orlistat vs XenicalOrlos, orlistat and Xenical all contain the same active ingredient orlistat, and work the same way. The main difference is that Orlos contains 60mg of orlistat, whereas orlistat (the generic version of Xenical) and Xenical contain 120mg. Therefore it’s worth noting that effects of treatment with orlos 60mg capsules might be more mild and gradual.Orlos, orlistat and Xenical are all treatments that must be taken alongside lifestyle changes like following a healthy balanced diet and exercise.Orlos vs MysimbaMysimba is an oral tablet just like Orlos. It contains the active ingredients naltrexone hydrochloride and bupropion hydrochloride which work to reduce your appetite. These ingredients work with the part of your brain that is responsible for hunger.Much like Orlos, it is most effective when taken alongside a healthy balanced diet and exercise.If you take Mysimba, you’ll start with taking 1 tablet every day until you gradually increase to 2 tablets twice a day after 4 weeks of your body adjusting to the treatment.Clinical studies have reported patients losing an average of 8.1% of their starting weight after 56 weeks of treatment.Orlos vs weight loss injectionsIf you are unsure if oral tablets like Orlos are the right weight loss treatment for you, weight loss injections like Mounjaro and Wegovy are also options that are available. However, weight loss injections are only available by prescription, unlike Orlos and alli which you can collect over the counter or request online with ease.Note: to receive treatment with weight loss injections you must have a BMI over 30 (or over 27 if you have additional weight-related health conditions).Weight loss injections reduce your appetite, helping you to lose weight and fulfil your weight loss goals. Both Wegovy and Mounjaro dosages are increased gradually so that your body can adjust to the treatment and lifestyle change requirements. Like Orlos, Mounjaro and Wegovy are most effective when taken alongside healthy nutritional and lifestyle changes recommended by a healthcare professional.At ZAVA, we can support you with this all the way. We offer free holistic support packages developed by our in-house nutritionists and doctors, as well as medical check-ins throughout your treatment with us.

    "question": "How long does it take for Mounjaro to work?Does Mounjaro work like insulin?",
    "answer": "Mounjaro works by reducing your appetite, so you feel fuller after having a meal. This helps you lose weight by making it easier to avoid overeating and snacking, reducing the amount of calories you eat.Mounjaro contains the active ingredient tirzepatide, which is a type of medication known as both a ‘GIP and GLP-1 agonist’. This means it mimics the effects of naturally occuring hormones that are responsible for regulating your appetite and the speed at which food moves through your intestines. It can also help to stabilise your blood sugar levels by increasing insulin production.How long does it take for Mounjaro to work?Mounjaro starts to work by reducing your appetite, but you might not start to feel the effect straight away. From week 1 onwards, you should feel Mounjaro working, though the extent of this varies from person to person.Weight loss treatment with Mounjaro is most effective when you follow a diet and exercise routine. You may find that you experience side effects between weeks 1 to 5 as your body adjusts to the medication. This may happen again during a dose increase but should get better over time. > Find out more information about how Mounjaro works and how to get the best results on Mounjaro. Does Mounjaro work like insulin?“Mounjaro (tirzepatide) is not an insulin, although it can help your body to produce more of it.

    "question": "Mounjaro Injection Sites How to inject MounjaroWorried about self-injecting ?What is the most effective way to inject Mounjaro? Can you stay on Mounjaro forever?What happens when you stop taking Mounjaro?",
    "answer": "To use Mounjaro injections safely, you should:take your current dose as instructed by your doctor – each Mounjaro pen contains 4 doses of the same strength (lasting 4 weeks)only inject Mounjaro (tirzepatide) into your skin, never into a vein or muscle inject Mounjaro once a week, at around the same time each week Always follow your doctor’s instructions, and read through the patient information leaflet and user manual carefully before taking Mounjaro. Once you have chosen a day and time that suits you to inject Mounjaro, you can prepare to take it. To prepare your Mounjaro injection: Wash your hands with soapy water, then dry them thoroughly. Check your displayed dosage is correct on the original packaging and is within date. Take your pen out of the box and check if it is damaged. You must not use a damaged pen.Remove the protective cap from the pen and check the dosage window – the liquid must be clear and free from debris or particles. If the solution is frozen, do not use it. Get a new needle ready, and make sure it is not unsealed, damaged, or bent in any way. Once you have prepared to take Mounjaro, you can prime your pen. It is important to prime your pen before every dose because you can be sure you receive the correct dose and your pen is working. To prime your Mounjaro pen: Remove the paper tab from the outer shield of your selected needle. Push the capped needle straight into the pen, and turn it clockwise until it is secured. Remove the outer needle shield, place it aside (you will need this later) then remove the inner needle shield and throw it in your household rubbish bin. Slowly turn the dose knob until you hear just 2 clicks, and see the extended line displaced in the dose window. This is the prime position. Release some medication into the air by pushing the dose knob until it stops. Slowly count to 5 until the ‘0’ icon is displayed in the dose window – do not inject it into your body. Once a small amount of medication is released from the pen needle tip, your pen is primed. Note: If you do not see any medication come out of the needle, repeat steps 9 to 11 no more than 2 extra times. If you still do not see any medication you should change the pen needle and repeat steps 9 to 11 no more than one more time. If this does not work, contact your doctor or pharmacist. Once your pen is primed you can inject Mounjaro.Mounjaro Injection Sites Mounjaro can be injected into your abdomen, upper legs, or upper arms with help from someone else. You should: switch injection sites weekly\ndivide the chosen area into 4 sections\ninject at least one finger width away from your last injection, and at least 5cm away from the belly button if injecting into your abdomen How to inject Mounjaro\nChoose your injection site. You do not need to squeeze or hold the area of the skin you want to inject. Turn the dose knob until it stops and the ‘1’ icon is displayed in the dose window. This represents one 0.6ml dose. Insert the needle into your skin at your chosen injection site. Make sure you or the person injecting can see the dose counter. Push the dose knob until it stops. Count to 5 while still holding the dose knob in, check the ‘0’ icon is shown in the dose window before removing the needle from your skin. Pull the needle from your skin. If you see a small drop of medication at the end of the needle after you remove it, this is completely normal and will not affect your treatment. If the ‘0’ icon is shown in the dose window, you have received the full dose of your Mounjaro injection. If you do not see the ‘0’ icon: insert the needle back into your skin and finish the injection, do not redial the dose. If you are unsure how to proceed, speak to a doctor or pharmacist. Once you have completed your dose of Mounjaro: Replace the outer needle shield onto the needle carefully, and discard it in your sharps bin. Replace the pen cap and store your pen away until it is time for your next dose. Worried about self-injecting ?“We understand that it may sound off-putting to self-inject your medication. However, the Mounjaro KwikPen is designed in a way that is easy for you to use, even without a clinical professional present. Your Mounjaro pen uses a pre-filled injection with a smaller needle which is different to injections you might have at your GP practice (such as for a vaccine).” – Dr Babak Ashrafi, Clinical Lead for Service Expansion. If you request self-injection medication from ZAVA, our doctors will give you advice on how to take it and you can message them for free through your account if you need extra support. What is the most effective way to inject Mounjaro? No particular injection site will make the medication more effective. The most effective place to inject Mounjaro is the one that is most comfortable for you. Can you stay on Mounjaro forever?Mounjaro is considered a safe and effective long-term weight loss treatment. Trials have reported the treatment safe to be taken for as long as 88 weeks. Studies reported a significant decrease in risk factors for weight-related conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes, and health benefits were reported with continued treatment with the maximum dose of tirzepatide. However, it’s important to note as with any medication, side effects can happen at any time. Taking Mounjaro may increase the risk of digestive problems, and in some cases cause conditions such as pancreatitis. If you get any side effects when taking Mounjaro, you must let your doctor know and monitor them. If they get worse, tell your doctor straight away. What happens when you stop taking Mounjaro?When you stop taking Mounjaro, the amount of tirzepatide in your system will slowly drop to nothing. You will lose the blood sugar-regulating effect and your appetite will go back to normal. If you’re using Mounjaro for weight loss and stop, you may find that your weight goes back to how it was before you started your treatment if you do not continue with your weight loss plan. The half-life of tirzepatide (Mounjaro) is around 5 to 7 days, if you stop using Mounjaro, tirzepatide should be gone from your body in about 30 days. You need to keep to your diet and exercise regime to make sure you don’t put weight back on. Weight loss requires a long-term commitment, even with medication.",

    "question": "What alternatives to Mounjaro are there?Weight loss injectionsWeight loss tablets",
    "answer": "There are a range of alternatives to Mounjaro available at ZAVA for weight loss, including treatment both in the form of injection, and tablets. Remember that each weight loss treatment works different for everybody. If you are no longer sure if Mounjaro is right for you and you are thinking of switching to an alternative treatment, it is best to get in touch with one of our doctors.Weight loss injectionsAlternative GLP-1 injections to Mounjaro (tirzepatide) include:WegovyWegovy is a once weekly injection that contains the active ingredient semaglutide. It works in a similar way to Mounjaro by helping you lose weight through the way that it works to curb your cravings and suppress your appetite. Patients have been reported to lose up an average of 21% of their starting weight over 72 weeks.For more information on Wegovy, check out our guides:Wegovy Dosages for Weight LossWegovy Side EffectsHow Does Wegovy Work?If you think Wegovy may be a better alternative for you and you are currently taking Mounjaro, you can find more information on switching from Mounjaro to Wegovy in our article.NevolatNevolat is a once daily injection. It contains liraglutide, which is the same active ingredient that was in Saxenda which is now long-term out of stock. Patients lose up to 8% of their starting weight in just 56 weeks on the maintenance dose of 3.0mg of Nevolat.If you are currently on your weight loss journey with us at ZAVA and are thinking of switching from Mounjaro, contact us on your patient account to let us know you are thinking of switching to Mounjaro. One of our doctors will be able to assess whether it is right for you based on your current personal health and medical history.Weight loss tabletsYou may feel that Mounjaro, an weekly injection medication, is not suiting your lifestyle. There are several oral pill based weight loss treatment alternatives if you feel injections are not right for you and your weight loss journey.Orlistat (120 mg)Orlistat is a weight loss tablet containing orlistat, it is taken three times a day at meal times. You must take the tablet with meals which contain fat because it works by reducing the amount of fat absorbed into your body. For best results, it should be taken alongside a low fat diet and regular exercise. Orlistat is available via prescription and is available in 120 mg at ZAVA.Xenical (120 mg)Xenical is a branded version of the generic Orlistat, which means it works in the exact same way (to reduce the amount of fat your body absorbs), it just has a different name, price and packaging. It contains the active ingredient orlistat. Just like orlistat, you should take it three times a day with meals, and when taking Xenical you should follow a low fat, low calorie diet and a regular exercise routine for it to be effective. Xenical is available via prescription only and is available in 120 mg at ZAVA.Alli (60 mg)Alli is an over-the-counter weight loss tablet, meaning it is available without a prescription. Like Xenical and Orlistat, it contains the active ingredient orlistat and therefore works in the same way to reduce the amount of fat that your body absorbs from meals. The tablets should only be taken up to three times per day at meal times, and the treatment is most effective when following a low-calorie, low-fat diet and regular exercise. Alli contains 60mg, which is less than the orlistat tablets (Orlistat and Xenical) on prescription that contain 120mg. Stuides have found that alli can help patients lose weight 50% faster than with dieting alone. Another study found 54.6% of patients lost at least 5% of their starting weight after 6 months of taking alli alongside a low-calorie and low-fat diet.MysimbaMysimba is an oral tablet that you take once or twice a day depending on what your doctor prescribes. It contains the active ingredients naltrexone hydrochloride and bupropion hydrochloride which work on the areas of your brain responsible for food intake, hunger levels and energy. In turn, it helps you lose weight by reducing your appetite so that you feel fuller for longer. In clinical studies, patients treated with Mysimba lost around 3.7 to 5.7% of their starting weight compared to 1.3 to 1.9% of patients taking a placebo.Thinking of switching from Mounjaro to an alternative weight loss treatment?

    "question": "How long does Mounjaro stay in your system?Is Mounjaro a GLP-1 agonist?Is there a cheaper alternative to Mounjaro?Can I take Mounjaro when I am pregnant or breastfeeding?How do I calculate my BMI?",
    "answer": "How long does Mounjaro stay in your system?Mounjaro has a half-life of 5 days. This is how long it takes for half the dose of tirzepatide to leave your system. After your last dose of Mounjaro, it should take around 25 days for all traces of it to leave your system.Is Mounjaro a GLP-1 agonist?Yes, Mounjaro is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, which means it acts like the hormone GLP-1 in your body. This is similar to other weight loss medications like Saxenda and Wegovy. However, unlike Saxenda and Wegovy, Mounjaro is also a GIP receptor agonist.Is there a cheaper alternative to Mounjaro?Cheaper alternatives to Mounjaro may include:XenicalOrlistatMysimbaSaxendaWegovyCan I take Mounjaro when I am pregnant or breastfeeding?No, Mounjaro isn’t safe for pregnancy or breastfeeding. There hasn’t been enough research into how this could affect the baby. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding and want weight loss treatment, talk to your GP.How do I calculate my BMI?Your body mass index (BMI) is a way to check your health based on your weight and height, and can let you know if you are underweight, healthy, or overweight. The way to calculate your BMI is your weight in kg divided by the square of your height in metres, or BMI = weight(kg)/height(m)2If you know your weight and height, you can quickly and easily calculate your BMI with our BMI weight loss calculator.",

    "answer": "They work in a similar way to regulate your appetite and blood sugar, helping to suppress your appetite and, in turn, reach your weight loss goals by making you feel fuller for longer. The only difference between the way the two work is that Mounjaro contains both GIP and GLP-1 agonists, but Wegovy only contains a GLP-1 agonist. Mounjaro might be a more effective weight loss treatment in the long term because it contains a GIP agonist, which can help with metabolism, in addition to the appetite suppression caused by GLP-1 agonists.",

    "answer": "Mounjaro and Ozempic both contain GLP-1 agonists, which work to regulate blood sugar, helping to increase fullness in patients taking Mounjaro, and enabling diabetic patients to control their blood sugar and their diabetes symptoms. Mounjaro is a dual receptor agonist which means it contains GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) agonists. Ozempic just contains a GLP-1 agonist. In Mounjaro, GIP and GLP-1 work together to both lower your appetite and change the way energy is stored and used in your body, meaning you can burn fat faster. On the other hand, the GLP-1 agonist alone in Ozempic only lowers appetite. Some patients may experience weight loss when taking semaglutide, but it is not approved for weight loss in the UK.",

Weight loss pills like Xenical, orlistat and alli work by reducing how much fat is absorbed into your body from meals which contain fat. It does this by passing the fat out of your body through your stools when you go to the toilet. Mysimba, on the other hand, works in a similar way to Mounjaro because it works to reduce your appetite by working on the part of your brain that is responsible for hunger. Like weight loss injections, weight loss pills are most effective when taken alongside a healthy, low-fat diet and exercise.",

    "question": "Fat",
    "answer": "Healthy fats should make up between 20 to 35% of your daily calories, and we recommend sticking to around 20% to 25% for the most effective weight loss results. You should limit or avoid unhealthy fats as much as possible while following your Mounjaro diet plan and after you stop taking it.Healthy fats include polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. The main difference between them is their chemical structures: polyunsaturated fats contain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and have a double carbon bond, while monounsaturated fats contain monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and have a single carbon bond. Here’s an overview of what they are and what foods contain them: What are they? What foods contain them? PUFAs A type of fat that includes omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.

    "question": "How long does one dose of Mounjaro stay in your system?",
    "answer": "Mounjaro medication stays in your body for an extended period due to its long half-life of approximately five days. This means it takes around five days for the amount of the medication in your blood to reduce by half. With weekly injections, you’ll have a consistent level of the medication in your system to support your treatment.If you stop taking Mounjaro, it can stay in your system for around 30 days. How long it lasts may depend on factors like dosage, as well as individual metabolism and kidney function. Being aware of this can help you better understand and plan your treatment or discuss any concerns with your doctor.",

Many people begin to see changes within the first few weeks of treatment, though this could also be influenced by adopting a new healthy diet and exercise routine as part of their weight-loss plan.An increase to 5mg is usually recommended after the initial 4-week period of 2.5mg. If you’re experiencing severe side effects, then more time on the starting dose or alternative treatment options may be recommended by your doctor.",

Always follow the dosage plan agreed with your doctor.How much your Mounjaro dose increases each month depends on a few different criteria, but it’s primarily based on how well you’re responding to treatment. You might not need to go beyond 5mg at all if it’s a suitable maintenance dose.",

    "question": "What happens if you double dose Mounjaro?",
    "answer": "Taking 2 doses of Mounjaro, either by combining multiple injections or taking more than prescribed, is not safe and should be avoided. Mounjaro doses are carefully titrated, meaning they are gradually increased according to your doctor’s plan to ensure the treatment works effectively and safely. Skipping this process could lead to heightened side effects and put your health at risk. Common symptoms of taking too much Mounjaro include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, and dizziness.Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) is rare but can occur, particularly if you are also taking other medications for diabetes. Monitoring your blood sugar at home, if possible, can be helpful in some mild cases. If you’re unsure whether your symptoms require medical attention, it’s best to call 111 or consult your doctor for guidance. Always follow your prescribed dosing schedule to avoid unnecessary risks.Important: If you experience severe or persistent symptoms like frequent vomiting, blood in your vomit, or abdominal pain that doesn’t go away, you should seek medical attention immediately.",

    "question": "I've accidentally ordered the wrong dose of Mounjaro, can I still use it?",
    "answer": "If you’re supposed to be on 5mg of Mounjaro but have ordered 2.5mg by mistake, technically double dosing your Mounjaro is providing you with the required amount of active tirzepatide. However, we’d advise against this due to the risk of miscalculating the number of Mounjaro pen clicks and potential negative side effects.Due to clinical safety guidelines, you cannot return your injection pen and exchange it for a different dose once it has been sent to you. If you have ordered the wrong dose, you will need to safely dispose of it and order the correct dosage. See how our service works for more information.",

    "question": "How long does Wegovy take to work?Can Wegovy be used for diabetes?",
    "answer": "Wegovy injections contain semaglutide, which mimics a natural hormone in your body that is released after you eat (glucagon-like peptide-1 or GLP-1) to make you feel fuller and help control your blood sugar.It sends signals to your brain that you’ve eaten, which reduces your appetite levels. It also increases the time it takes for food to empty from your stomach, so you feel fuller for longer after eating. This can stop you overeating or snacking, making it easier to stick to your weight loss plan. Taking it once a week keeps the level of semaglutide in your body constant, which helps you feel fuller all of the time.For a comprehensive understanding of Wegovy, you can watch \"Everything you need to know about Wegovy\" in this informative video.How long does Wegovy take to work?After you start your treatment, you should feel fuller after eating by the second or third dose. But since people react differently to medications, it might work slightly faster or slower for you. You could see Wegovy weight loss results as early as 12 weeks after starting treatment. If you have not lost significant weight after 6 months, you should think about changing your treatment.Can Wegovy be used for diabetes?Wegovy is not meant for diabetes treatment, but the active ingredient semaglutide is also used to treat diabetes by supporting weight loss and controlling blood sugar. Ozempic is a medication with the same active ingredient intended for people with type 2 diabetes.",

    "question": "Some extra advice:Wegovy missed doseWhat happens when you stop taking Wegovy?",
    "answer": "Before starting treatment, carefully read the instructions in the patient information leaflet that comes with your Wegovy and follow any instructions from your doctor as well. When you’re ready to try your first dose, follow these steps:Wash your hands.Decide on where you want to inject your first dose. You can choose from your lower abdomen or thigh. The upper arm can also be used with the help of another person. Once you’ve decided, wash the area you’re going to inject with an alcohol swab or soap and water.Check the name and dose of your pen to make sure it contains your prescribed dose of Wegovy. Look through the pen window to ensure the liquid is clear and colourless.Remove the pen cap and push a new needle onto the pen. Turn the needle until it is tight. Pull off the outer and inner needle caps when ready to inject or check the flow. Check the flow with each new pen. You do not need to check the flow every time you inject, only the first time you use a new pen. Each pen will provide you with 4 weekly doses when used correctly.Turn the dose selector until the dose counter stops, and it shows your prescribed dose.Insert the needle into your skin, making sure to avoid any veins or muscles. Ensure you can see the dose counter.Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter shows 0. Keep pressing the dose button with the needle in your skin and slowly count to 6. There should be a first and second clicking noise to indicate when the injection starts and when it’s finished.Remove the needle from your skin. Carefully place the outer needle cap onto the needle, before removing the needle from the pen and disposing of it in a sharps bin.Place the pen cap back onto the pen and store out of sight and reach of children. The pen can be stored for up to 28 days at a temperature below 30°C or refrigerator (2°C to 8°C) away from the cooling element.\nSome extra advice:\nStore your injections in the fridge before opening.Check your pen before using it in case it’s been broken, like if it’s been dropped.Avoid injecting into areas that are bruised, sore, hard or scarred. Also, be careful not to inject into your muscles or veins.Do not touch the needle cover to avoid accidentally pricking yourself.Do not try and stop the injection halfway through because the needle locks once it starts.Make sure you switch up where you inject your Wegovy dose after each use.For more information, read our guide on how to take Wegovy injections.Wegovy missed doseIf you miss a dose by 5 days or less, you can take that dose. Your next one should be taken on your usual day, as long as it’s been at least 3 days since your last injection.If you miss a dose and it’s more than 5 days, then wait (i.e. skip that dose) and take your next dose on the usual day, at the usual time.If you want to change the day of the week you use Wegovy to better suit your needs, you can do so as long as there are more than 3 days between doses.If the last dose you took was more than 2 weeks ago, you need to restart at the lowest strength dose of 0.25mg weekly, and follow the Wegovy dosage schedule again. What happens when you stop taking Wegovy?There’s no risk of addiction or withdrawal symptoms when it comes to stopping your treatment. Be aware that your appetite will increase to normal levels once you stop using Wegovy, so you need to account for this in your plan to maintain your lower weight.",

    "question": "Wegovy vs MounjaroWegovy vs liraglutide (generic Saxenda)Is Saxenda better than Wegovy?OzempicIs Ozempic the same as Wegovy?Other medical weight loss treatment and options",
    "answer": "Wegovy vs MounjaroMounjaro is another weight loss treatment that was originally used to treat type 2 diabetes, like Ozempic. It contains tirzepatide and is also a prescription-only injection. It works in a similar way to Wegovy to reduce your appetite and help support weight loss alongside diet and exercise. The main difference is that it mimics a second hormone that is thought to enhance the effects of GLP-1. For a detailed comparison of these medications, you can find more information on our Wegovy vs Mounjaro page. Mounjaro prices are rising from 1 September 2025: find out more about the Mounjaro price change.Wegovy vs liraglutide (generic Saxenda)Liraglutide (Nevolat) works in almost exactly the same way as Wegovy. The only real differences are the active ingredients, liraglutide instead of semaglutide, and the fact that liraglutide is taken once a day. They both work by reducing your appetite.Is Saxenda better than Wegovy?Clinical trials have shown that Wegovy is a more effective weight loss injection, and can lead to more weight loss than Saxenda over the same period of time. However, Wegovy may not be suitable for everybody, so Saxenda is still a good option for those who can’t use Wegovy.Saxenda is long term out of stock but a generic version, Nevolat, is available. It works in exactly the same way it just has a different name, price and packaging.OzempicOzempic is another name for semaglutide (the active ingredient in Wegovy). Wegovy is prescribed for patients with or without diabetes for weight loss but Ozempic is only meant to treat people for type 2 diabetes. Is Ozempic the same as Wegovy?The active ingredient in both Ozempic and Wegovy is the same, but the dosages are different. This is because the dosage in Ozempic is suitable for managing diabetes, while the dosage in Wegovy is higher as it has a better effect on weight loss. Ozempic is available in 0.25mg, 0.5mg, or 1mg doses.Other medical weight loss treatment and optionsOther Wegovy alternatives include:Mysimba, weight loss tablets that help reduce appetiteOrlistat, tablets that stop your body absorbing fatXenical, a branded version of OrlistatDiet, exercise and other lifestyle changes should be used alongside medication to promote weight loss.",

This helps you lose weight, as the fat is passed out of your body through your stools instead of being absorbed into your body.What does Xenical do to your body?Xenical tablets belong to a group of medications called “lipase inhibitors”.

Instead, the fat is passed out of your body as stool waste.How long does Xenical take to work?Xenical can start working within a few days but it may take 2 weeks or longer for you to start seeing results. You should expect some weight loss results within the first 3 months of taking Xenical.Speak to your doctor if you have not lost at least 5% of your starting body weight (your weight at the start of treatment), after taking Xenical for 3 months.

    "question": "Who can use Xenical?When should I take Xenical?What is the best way to use Xenical?How long can you take Xenical for?Can you skip a day on Xenical?",
    "answer": "Swallow 1 tablet of Xenical after every main meal that contains fat, up to 3 times per day. This is usually at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You should swallow your capsules whole with water. If you eat a meal that doesn’t contain fat, you shouldn’t take Xenical.Who can use Xenical?Xenical is recommended for people:with a BMI of over 30kg/m2with a BMI of over 28kg/m2, and other medical conditions like type 2 diabetes or high blood pressurewho have tried other weight loss options like diet and exercise but have been unsuccessfulOur doctors will take your BMI and medical history into consideration and may prescribe off-label when making a decision about treatment.When should I take Xenical?You should take Xenical tablets with every main meal that contains fat, up to 3 times per day.You can take Xenical immediately before, during or up to 1 hour after a main meal containing fat. Do not take Xenical if you miss a meal or the meal doesn’t contain fat.What is the best way to use Xenical?“The best way to use Xenical is alongside complementary lifestyle changes that can help you lose weight. Keep your dietary fat consumption at around 30% of your daily calorie intake, then split this evenly between your 3 main meals alongside Xenical. Working with your doctor or another weight loss specialist to create a calorie-controlled diet plan and exercise routine will make Xenical even more effective in helping you lose weight.” – Dr Brenda Ikeji, Medical Editor.How long can you take Xenical for?You typically take Xenical for 3-6 months, but it can be prescribed for up to a year in some cases. It is thought that there is no time limit on how long you can safely take Xenical, as long as you are seeing positive results from it. However, you should not continue to take Xenical longer without an assessment with your doctor.Can you skip a day on Xenical?You only need to take Xenical after eating a meal that contains fat, so if you go for a day without eating a fatty meal then you could skip a day of Xenical. Otherwise, skipping days of Xenical is likely to have less of an effect on your weight loss journey than taking it every day, especially if you’re eating fatty meals. If you accidentally skip or miss your Xenical dose, take it as soon as you remember as long as it is within an hour of your last meal, then continue your next dose as usual. If it is outside this time or you miss several doses, inform your doctor for further advice. Do not change your dose yourself or take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.",

    "question": "Orlistat vs XenicalXenical vs alliXenical vs WegovyXenical vs MounjaroXenical vs Mysimba",
    "answer": "Xenical is an effective weight loss treatment but it may not be right for you. Fortunately, there are alternative weight loss medications available to help you.Orlistat vs XenicalXenical tablets are a branded version of Orlistat, meaning they are the same medication and work in the same way. The only difference between Xenical and Orlistat is the name on the box, the manufacturer and the price.Xenical vs alliXenical and alli are both branded versions of orlistat, which means they work in the same way. However, alli is only available at the lower dosage of 60mg, while Xenical is available at 120mg. Because it is a higher dosage, Xenical is more effective for most people than alli.Unlike Xenical, alli is available over-the-counter, while Xenical requires a prescription before you can get it.Xenical vs WegovyWegovy (semaglutide) is a weight loss injection that works differently from Xenical tablets. While Xenical helps you lose weight by changing how your body absorbs fat, Wegovy works by reducing your appetite and keeping food in the stomach for longer to promote feelings of fullness. This helps you lose weight by reducing your calorie intake, as you don’t need to eat as much to feel full.Wegovy might be a good alternative if you do not like swallowing tablets, or if Xenical is not safe for you to take.Xenical vs MounjaroMounjaro is another weight loss injection like Wegovy that contains tirzepatide as the active ingredient. It also works by reducing your appetite and delaying the emptying of your stomach, so you’ll feel fuller for longer while following a diet plan and reducing your calorie intake to lose weight. While Xenical is a pill taken 3 times per day, Mounjaro is an injection that comes in an injectable pen with pre-filled doses and only needs to be taken once a week.\nXenical vs MysimbaXenical and Mysimba are both weight loss pills but they work in very different ways. While Xenical reduces fat absorption, the active ingredients in Mysimba (bupropion and naltrexone) work on the energy centres in the brain to reduce your appetite. Mysimba is taken on an increasing dosage schedule to a maximum daily dose of 2 tablets, twice a day. Active Ingredients\nPrice Orlistat (pill)\nOrlistat\nfrom £24.99 Xenical (pill)\nOrlistat\nfrom £59.95 Mysimba (pill)\nNaltrexone and buproprion\nfrom £99.00 Wegovy (injection)\nSemaglutide\nfrom £139.00 Mounjaro (injection)\nTirzepatide\nfrom £139.00",

    "answer": "How do I know if Xenical is working?Xenical starts working in 1-2 days, but you might not see results for up to 2 weeks. One of the more obvious signs that Xenical is working is passing more oily stools than normal, which show that unabsorbed fat is being passed out through your stool. Losing weight is another sign that Xenical is working.Does Xenical work on existing fat?No, Xenical will not reduce or burn existing fat, it can only reduce the amount of fat your body absorbs from future meals.Can I take Xenical if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?No, it is currently not recommended to take Xenical when pregnant or breastfeeding. This is because the medication may pass on to your newborn child through breast milk, or to your unborn baby in the womb.Does Xenical make you pass stools more frequently?Yes, Xenical can make you need to pass stools more urgently or more frequently if you eat a fatty meal. This is because some of the fat you eat will be passed on when you go to the bathroom, so if you eat a very fatty meal, it increases the amount of fat in your stool.",

    "question": "What does orlistat do to your body?How long does orlistat take to work?",
    "answer": "Orlistat works by changing how your body digests fat. When you take it, it blocks lipase, an enzyme found in the intestines that helps break down and digest fats. Once lipase is blocked, around a third of the fat you eat with your meal is passed out of your body as stool, instead of being absorbed. It won’t work if you don’t eat any fat with your meal, or you take it without eating. What does orlistat do to your body?Orlistat tablets contain the active ingredient orlistat, which is a lipase inhibitor. This medication prevents certain enzymes, called lipase, from breaking down dietary fats in your food. This stops some of the fat in your food from being absorbed into your body and instead causes it to be passed out in your stool when you go to the bathroom. This means it’s common to get oily or loose stools, or an increased need to use the bathroom. You can reduce these side effects by splitting your dietary fat evenly between 3 meals. The manufacturer recommends that around 30% of your daily calories be in the form of fat, which should be split across 3 meals. How long does orlistat take to work?Orlistat starts to work within 1-2 days after first taking it, but it can take up to 2 weeks until you start to see results. Most patients say they see the best results in the first 3 months of taking orlistat. Your doctor will check you’ve lost at least 5% of your starting weight within 12 weeks of taking orlistat, or they may recommend trying a different weight loss medication.",

Orlistat can change how often or how quickly you need to pass a stool as a common side effect but if you’re eating low-fat meals, it may not change the frequency of your bowel movements too much. If you eat a fatty meal, you may notice an increased urgency to use the bathroom because there is more fat being passed through your stool.What is another name for orlistat?Orlistat is a generic medication that is also sold under the names alli and Xenical. These medications are branded versions of orlistat. All orlistat brands work in the exact same way.Why am I not losing weight on orlistat?You need to follow a diet and exercise plan while taking orlistat. It won’t help you lose weight without changes to your diet, so make sure you’re eating plenty of fruits and veg, cutting down your daily fat intake, and reducing your calorie intake by around 600 calories a day. You should also be getting around 150 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise per week.Our weight loss support pack can help you get the most from your weight loss journey, which will be supplied with your orlistat prescription.“Orlistat usually starts working straight away, and most people experience weight loss within the first few weeks. However, it can take up to 3 months to see results. If you have been taking orlistat alongside other weight loss strategies for longer than 3 months and haven’t lost weight, it may be that orlistat is not an effective treatment for you.” – Dr Brenda Ikeji, Medical Editor.How long does orlistat stay in your system?Orlistat stays in your system for a relatively short period of time, and you may still feel the effects for 12 to 72 hours after your last pill. It takes about 3 to 5 days for the medication to completely leave your body after you stop taking it.What happens if you take orlistat without eating?If you take orlistat without eating, you will see no weight loss benefits. Orlistat works by reducing the amount of fat your body absorbs from food. If you stop eating, there is no fat intake to be reduced, and so nothing will happen. This is why you also do not need to take orlistat if you have a meal that doesn’t contain fat.",

    "question": "How fast does it work?How long does it last?",
    "answer": "Saxenda contains liraglutide, which behaves like the natural hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Usually, GLP-1 is released from your intestines after you have eaten a meal, which tells your brain you are full.When Saxenda is injected, it also tells your brain that you are full, which helps you control your appetite. Saxenda helps to decrease your appetite over time, so you find it easier to eat less and lose weight.How fast does it work?It’s realistic to expect to lose over 8% of your body weight after 12 weeks on the highest dose of Saxenda, after you’ve spent 4 weeks building up to that dose (16 weeks total). It’s important to combine Saxenda with a diet and exercise plan to achieve the best results.How long does it last?A single dose of Saxenda stays in your body for about 2 days and about half of it is gone in the first 13 hours.Depending on your response to the medication and your weight loss goals, you may finish your course before or continue beyond 12 weeks of the highest dose (16 weeks total). When you have achieved your weight loss goals, your doctor will talk you through stopping your treatment.➤ Read more about how long Saxenda's effect lasts.",

    "answer": "Your doctor will talk you through your treatment plan. Your dose will increase as your body gets used to the treatment until you reach the highest dose of 3mg a day. You should only keep taking Saxenda if you have lost at least 8% of your body weight after being on the maintenance dose for 12 weeks.You should use Saxenda at the same time each day to get the best results. Find a time of the day that works best for you, such as in the morning. You can take Saxenda with or without food and drink.Your Saxenda pen should only be used with the provided needles.

To protect your skin you should use a new injection site each day. You can choose between the following injection sites:the front of your abdomen (below your stomach), which is the most commonly recommended injection sitethe front of your thighthe top of your armNever inject your medicine into a vein or muscle.Throw away your needle after your injectionWhen the needle has been removed from your skin, use the outer needle cap from earlier to safely dispose of the needle. Never touch the needle with your fingers, as this could cause you to hurt yourself.Once the needle is covered, make sure the outer cap is on completely and unscrew the needle from your Saxenda pen and throw it away.Never reuse or share a needleNever share your needles or Saxenda pen with anyone else. Saxenda must be prescribed to you.You’ll always be given enough needles when you request Saxenda from ZAVA. If you need more, speak to your online doctor. If a needle is bent or damaged do not use it.Stick to your weight loss plan during treatmentStick to the diet and exercise plan that your doctor recommends during treatment, since Saxenda alone doesn’t cause weight loss. Your doctor will assess your treatment regularly to make sure you are losing weight and Saxenda is working as it should.Do you need to avoid certain foods?There’s no foods that react badly with Saxenda so you don’t have to completely cut anything out of your diet. But, since a healthy diet is important for getting the most out of Saxenda treatment, there are some foods you could cut down on or avoid, including:sugary foods and drinks, like cakes, biscuits, breakfast bars, fizzy drinks, fruit juices foods high in saturated fats, like crisps, fast foods, fried foods",

    "answer": "Is there a generic version?Yes, a generic version of Saxenda is available under the name of Nevolat. It contains the same active ingredient, liraglutide, and works in the exact same way - it just has a different name, price and packaging. Why am I not losing weight on saxenda?Saxenda doesn’t cause weight loss by itself and doesn’t work for everyone. Make sure you stick to your diet and exercise plan to help Saxenda work properly. If it’s been 16 weeks since you started treatment and you’ve stuck to your diet and exercise plan and you still haven’t lost weight, talk to your doctor about changing to another treatment.What happens when you miss a dose?When you miss a dose the level of Saxenda in your body will drop slightly. Every time you take a dose you’re ‘topping up’ the amount of Saxenda in your body. If your levels do drop, you might notice feeling less full after eating.When you miss a dose of Saxenda and it’s still the same day, take your dose as normal. If you remember you forgot one yesterday or earlier, just take your normal dose when you’re supposed to. Don’t take extra Saxenda to make up for missing doses on other days and never take two doses on the same day.If you miss 2 or more doses in a row, talk to your doctor about restarting treatment.Will I gain weight after stopping Saxenda?After you stop Saxenda, you will stop feeling as full after eating. But, if you stick to the diet and exercise plan you were on when you were losing weight with Saxenda, you should be able to keep the weight off. If you start struggling with weight after stopping Saxenda, talk to your GP.Is Saxenda insulin?No, Saxenda contains a different active ingredient to insulin, liraglutide. Liraglutide is a man-made hormone which does help increase insulin production in your body so it does help stop insulin spiking after you eat. Insulin and liraglutide may be prescribed together to help people with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar and weight.Can you lose weight on Saxenda without dieting?Saxenda is only meant to be used as part of a weight loss plan that includes diet and exercise. Since Saxenda does make you feel fuller, you are likely to want to eat less when taking it anyway, but it’s important that you don’t rely on Saxenda alone.Does Saxenda work straight away?Saxenda can make you feel fuller after just one or two doses, but it will take some time for you to start losing weight after you begin treatment.How many Saxenda pens will I need?Saxenda comes in packs of 1, 3, and 5 pens. How many pens you need depends on what stage of treatment you’re at. As you move onto higher doses of Saxenda, you’ll get fewer doses out of each pen.Your first pack should include enough pens for you to work up to the highest dose, 5 pens in total that will last about 6 weeks. Once you’re on the highest dose, each pen will last about a week and a pack of 5 pens will last 30 days.Does Saxenda cause hair loss?Hair loss is not a side effect of Saxenda. But, some people can get temporary hair loss from losing weight quickly, known as telogen effluvium. This type of hair loss usually fixes itself after about 6 months as your body adapts to your new weight.Why is Saxenda out of stock?Saxenda is out of stock because of an unexpected surge in demand, which the manufacturer was not able to keep up with. Because of this, there is a global shortage of Saxenda, which only Nord Norvodisk can make.When will Saxenda be back in stock?We currently do not know when Saxenda will be back in stock, as there is a global shortage of this medication. Generic liraglutide, which is a weight loss medication that works exactly the same as Saxenda and is just as effective, works in the exact same way and is available under the name Nevolat. Why am I still hungry on Saxenda?It is normal to still feel hungry while taking Saxenda. Saxenda works by suppressing your appetite, but it does not get rid of the feeling of hunger completely. You will just feel less hungry than normal, and you won’t need to eat as much food to feel full.You should make sure you’re still eating enough while taking Saxenda. Eating nutritious, balanced meals containing fibre will help you feel fuller.Speak to your doctor if Saxenda isn’t working to suppress your hunger at all after taking it for 6 weeks, as you may need to reach the maintenance dose of 3mg first to get the full effect from treatment.",

    "question": "How long does alli stay in your system?How fast does alli work?",
    "answer": "alli pills work by stopping your body from absorbing fats from meals, which instead leave your body as waste to help you lose weight. The active ingredient achieves this because it is a type of lipase inhibitor. Lipase is an enzyme made in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas. It’s used to break down fat from food, which is then absorbed by your intestines.When you take alli capsules, they stop lipase from activating. This means some of the fat from your meal will not be absorbed. Instead, around a third of the fat will leave your body as waste through bowel movements (poop).How long does alli stay in your system?alli stays in your digestive system for around 6 hours. It usually takes 3 to 5 days for alli to fully leave your system. It will become less effective during this time, which means you need to take it with every meal containing fat for it to reach full effect.How fast does alli work?alli starts to work within a few hours, but it may take a few weeks for you to see weight loss results.",

    "question": "How long does Nevolat last?How long does Nevolat take to work? How effective is Nevolat?",
    "answer": "Nevolat contains the active ingredient liraglutide and is self-injected daily. Once in your system, it works by mimicking a naturally occurring hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is typically released from your intestines after you have eaten a meal and tells your brain that you are full. This effect can help you control your appetite so you find it easier to eat less and lose weight faster. How long does Nevolat last?A single dose of Nevolat stays in your body for around 2 days but half of it is gone within 12 hours. It is important to take Nevolat as instructed by your doctor to get the most effective and safe treatment.How long does Nevolat take to work? Clinical trials with Nevolat (liraglutide) have shown patients to have lost at least 5% of their body weight within just 12 weeks of taking liraglutide after a gradual increase of dosage up to the maximum 3mg maintenance dose.For Nevolat to be most effective, it’s important that you follow a balanced diet and exercise plan during your treatment. How effective is Nevolat? Studies have shown Nevolat to be a highly effective treatment alongside diet and exercise changes. Patients have seen an 8.0% reduction in their body weight in just 56 weeks of taking liraglutide.",

    "question": "Preparing your penChecking the flowInjecting your dose",
    "answer": "Your doctor should outline a treatment plan with Nevolat which is tailored to your healthcare needs based on your medical background and BMI. Although it may seem daunting at first, the injection pen for Nevolat is easy to use and comes pre-filled with the doses you need. Preparing your pen1: Prepare your pen with a new needle – be sure to check the name and coloured label of your pen to check that it contains Nevolat and pull off the cap if it is correct. 2: Check that the solution in your pen is clear, you will be able to check this by looking through the pen window. If the solution is cloudy do not use.3: Take a new needle and tear off the paper tab. 4: Make sure to attach your needle correctly by pushing the needle straight into the pen and turning it tight. 5: The needle is covered by 2 caps – you must remove both for the solution to run through. Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You will need it after the injection to safely remove the needle from the pen. 6: Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. A drop of solution may appear on the needle tip, this is normal. Do not attach a new needle to your pen until you are ready to take your injection. Always use a new needle for each injection and check your needle is not bent or damaged.Checking the flowBefore your first injection with each new pen, you must ‘check the flow’. Doing this will ensure that your needle and solution are ready before you insert it into your skin. 7: To check the flow all you need to do is turn the dose selector until the dose counter shows a symbol that looks like this: .----8: Hold the pen with the needle pointed up. Press and hold the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. A drop of solution should appear at the needle tip, a small drop may remain at the needle tip but it will not be injected. 9: If no drop appears, repeat this process up to 6 times, if this does not work, change the needle and repeat this process. If this still doesn’t work, you may need a new pen. Checking the flow is important to ensure you are using a pen that is not blocked or damaged so you can get the right amount of medication. Injecting your dose 10: Once you have checked the flow, select your dose by turning the dose selector on the end of the pen. Be careful to ensure you select the correct dose. More information on how this looks can be found in your how-to-use instruction guide or in the patient information leaflet. 11: Inject your dose by inserting the needle in your skin as your doctor or nurse has shown you. Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter shows 0, you should hear or feel a click. 12: Keep the needle in your skin after the dose counter has reached 0 and count slowly to 6 to ensure full delivery of your dose.13: Remove the needle from your skin and release the dose button. There is more information on dose counter clicks in the patient information leaflet. 14: After your injection, lead the needle tip into the needle cap on a flat surface without touching the needle or outer cap. Once covered, carefully push the outer cap on, unscrew the needle, and dispose of it carefully.",

    "question": "When should I take Nevolat? How much Nevolat should I take?  How long do you need to take Nevolat for? What if I miss a dose of Nevolat?  What if I take too much Nevolat? Can you change dosage?",
    "answer": "The Nevolat dosages, and the starting and maximum dosages, are as follows: Week Dose injected (once daily) 1\n0.6mg (starting dose) 2\n1.2mg 3\n1.8mg 4\n2.4mg 5+\n3.0mg (maximum dosage) Your dosage of Nevolat is gradually increased until the maximum recommended dosage is reached (3mg). This is so your body can gradually get used to the medication while reducing the risk of side effects. If you experience any side effects on lower dosages before reaching 3mg your doctor may discuss an alternative weight loss treatment with you or may recommend staying on a lower dose for longer to see if they go away, as long as they are not severe or serious. When should I take Nevolat? We recommend injecting Nevolat around the same time each day. Choose a time that works for you each day, such as just after breakfast. Sticking to the same time each day can help your body get used to the medication schedule, reducing side effects and improving its effectiveness. How much Nevolat should I take? You must take Nevolat as prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will advise a 0.6mg starting dose of Nevolat to be injected once daily, this is gradually increased each week under the supervision of your doctor. How long do you need to take Nevolat for?\nIt is safe to take Nevolat long-term; you should take Nevolat for as long as it takes to reach your goal weight unless you experience any unwanted side effects or you don’t see results and decide to stop or change your weight loss treatment. What if I miss a dose of Nevolat? If you forget your dose of Nevolat and it is: within 12 hours since the time you typically inject Nevolat, inject it as soon as you remember more than 12 hours since you should have injected Nevolat, inject your next dose the following day at the usual time more than 2 days (48 hours) since you should have injected Nevolat, you must start back on the starting dose of 0.6mg and work your way up as before You should never double the dose or increase the dose on the following day to make up for the missed dose, this could cause adverse side effects. What if I take too much Nevolat?\nIf you think you may have taken more Nevolat than you should, speak to your doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Can you change dosage?\nYes, you can change dosage while taking Nevolat. A normal dosage schedule includes increasing your dose once a week for the first 5 weeks.\nYou may also want to switch dosage if you start to experience side effects after increasing your dose, which would mean lowering your dose again or not increasing it for the time being.\nIf you are taking the maximum dosage of Nevolat and are not seeing the results you need, you should speak to your doctor and they may be able to suggest switching to Wegovy or Mounjaro which have higher weight loss results in clinical trials.",

    "answer": "Nevolat is an effective weight loss treatment, however this does not mean that it is right for everyone.

Nevolat may not be recommended if you: have severe heart failure are 75 years or older (due to little research on patients taking it) have kidney problems (disease or dialysis) have liver problems have severe gut or stomach problems (gastroparesis or inflammatory bowel disease) are due to have surgery with anaesthesia have pancreas disease have inflamed gallbladder or gallstones have certain thyroid diseaseshave a racing heartbeat are under the age of 18 Nevolat is not a replacement treatment for diabetes, inform your doctor if you have diabetes.

    "question": "Weight loss injections Weight loss tablets Nevolat vs Saxenda  Nevolat vs Wegovy Nevolat vs Mounjaro",
    "answer": "There are a range of alternatives to Nevolat which are licensed and approved for use in the UK. These include other weight loss injections and weight loss tablets. Weight loss treatments available at ZAVA include:Weight loss injections Mounjaro (tirzepatide)Mounjaro is a self-injectable weight loss treatment which contains the active ingredient tirzepatide. Tirzepatide works by mimicking 2 naturally occurring hormones in your body called GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). These work by controlling your appetite, helping you feel fuller for longer, in turn enabling you to lose weight due to lessening your cravings after a meal. Wegovy (semaglutide)Wegovy is a self-injectable weight loss medication which contains semaglutide. Semaglutide mimics GLP-1 (like Nevolat) which works with your intestines after you have eaten a meal to send messages to your brain to signal you are full. In turn, this can help you lose weight as you feel fuller for longer. Like Nevolat, Mounjaro and Wegovy must be taken alongside a balanced diet and regular exercise for it to be most effective. Weight loss tablets Mysimba Mysimba is a tablet which is taken once daily and gradually increased to twice daily. It works by sending messages to the brain that control your energy levels and food intake. It can reduce your appetite as it helps you feel fuller for longer and reduces cravings. Orlistat, Xenical and alli Orlistat, Xenical and alli all work in the same way as they all contain the same active ingredient orlistat. Orlistat works by attaching to enzymes in your digestive system called lipase, blocking it from breaking down fat in your food and absorbing it into your body. As a result, the fat turns to waste (stool). These tablets must be taken with meals that contain fat to work. alli contains a lower dosage of orlistat than Orlistat and Xenical and it is available over-the-counter. Mysimba, Orlistat, Xenical and alli must be taken alongside a balanced diet and regular exercise for it to be most effective. Nevolat vs Saxenda Nevolat and Saxenda contain the exact same ingredient (liraglutide), which means they work in the same way and are taken the exact same way, too. The only differences are the price, name, packaging and non-active ingredients. Saxenda is now long-term out of stock. If Saxenda worked for you, Nevolat may be a suitable new alternative. To find out, request a consultation and one of our doctors can assess if it is safe and suitable for you. Nevolat vs Wegovy Wegovy and Nevolat work in the exact same way, they both reduce your appetite and increase feelings of fullness. However, Wegovy contains the active ingredient semaglutide and is taken weekly, whereas Nevolat contains liraglutide and is taken daily.Clinical trials have found that patients lost an average of 21% of their starting body weight after 72 weeks.Nevolat vs MounjaroWegovy and Nevolat work in almost the exact same way, they both work to reduce your appetite and increase feelings of fullness. However, Mounjaro contains the active ingredient tirzepatide which mimics a second hormone to increase its effects and is taken weekly, whereas Nevolat contains liraglutide and is taken daily.Clinical trials have shown Mounjaro to be an effective weight loss treatment with patients losing up to 22.5% of their starting weight after 72 weeks on the highest maintenance dosage. Clinical trials on Nevolat have found that patients have lost 8.0% of their weight in 56 weeks on the highest maintenance dosage. Weight loss looks different for everyone. It is important to discuss with your doctor your personal health needs and they should be able to assess a safe, suitable and effective treatment plan for you.",

    "answer": "Wash your hands with soap and water and clean a flat surface to put your test on. Once you have prepared and checked that all the contents in your pack are correct, you can begin taking the test.Put the test strip on a clean, flat surface. Place your extraction tube in the holder located on or inside the box. If your tube does not have liquid in it, you can then take out the sachet and pour this into the tube.Blow your nose and rewash your hands with soap and water.Take the cotton swab from the packet, making sure not to touch the soft end. Choose a nostril and insert the swab until you feel resistance. This is usually about 2.5cm up your nose. If you have a nose piercing, it is best to take the swab in the other nostril. Gently swab your nose by making 10 complete circles. This can feel uncomfortable but should not be painful. Get the extraction tube from earlier and place the soft end of the swab in the liquid. Rotate the swab in the liquid for about 15 seconds. Make sure to press the swab against the inner edge of the extraction tube, so your nose sample can be passed into the liquid for testing.After 15 seconds, remove all liquid from the swab by pressing it against the side of the tube. Throw away the swab in the waste bag that was provided in your pack.Put the lid on the extraction tube and wash your hands again.Gently squeeze 2 drops of liquid from the extraction tube onto the test strip, into the specimen well which is located with an ‘S’. Throw the extraction tube in the waste bag.Wait for 30 minutes before reading your result. A positive result is where 2 lines appear. A negative result is 1 line in the control region, marked by a ‘C’. A void result is 1 line marked in the test region, marked with a ‘T’. After you have registered your result, you can throw away the test in the waste bag.The instructions for taking your test can be found within the packet. If you need assistance when taking a lateral flow test, you can message one of our doctors for free on your online account.",

    "question": "What do my results mean?",
    "answer": "When you take a lateral flow test, you can get 3 results. A positive result is shown when 2 lines appear on your test. One in the control region ‘C’ and one in the test region ‘T’. If you test positive for COVID-19, you must follow government guidelines and reduce your contact with others. You can still get a PCR test at a local testing facility, or order one to your home. You can take another lateral flow test after 5 days to check if you are still positive.If you are negative, a single line will appear across the control region. There should be no line in the test line region. This means you were likely not infected with COVID-19 at the time of the test.A void result means that the test did not work properly and you must repeat it. A void result is where a single line appears over the test line region ‘T’, but not on the control line ‘C’.",

    "question": "What is a COVID-19 PCR test?",
    "answer": "A Covid-19 PCR test is an accurate way to test if you have COVID-19. The test requires you to take a swab sample from your nose and tonsils. Your sample is then sent to a laboratory for testing. PCR stands for polymerase chain reaction. The test detects genetic material (called RNA) from the virus in your body. The virus that causes COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2.",

    "question": "What is a UTI?",
    "answer": "UTIs (urinary tract infections) affect your urinary tract, the system through which urine is passed from the kidneys and out of the body. UTIs can affect any part of the urinary tract, including the urethra (urethritis), kidneys (kidney function), and bladder (cystitis). They are caused by bacteria entering the urinary tract which causes inflammation and infection. Cystitis is a type of urinary tract infection that affects the bladder and is particularly common in women, but it can affect anyone. Women are more susceptible because they have a shorter urethra than men, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys and cause an infection.Some of the common symptoms of a UTI include: pain or burning sensation when going for a peeneeding to pee more often than usual, including at nightsudden urge to pee or more needing to pee more urgently than normalcloudy peeblood in your peelower tummy or back paina feververy low temperature below 36°C",

    "answer": "The UTI TestCard test kit is easy to use. Begin by downloading the TestCard App. You will need this to get your results. The TestCard works with a range of iPhone and Android devices. If you’re not sure if your mobile device is compatible, you can check and download the app from the TestCard website.Once you have downloaded the app, you’re ready to collect and test your sample. Each TestCard is supplied with its own set of UTI strips, so make sure you are using the correct strips for your TestCard. To use the UTI TestCard, you should:Get a clean container to collect your urine sample.Open a pouch and hold the test strip at the top so you can scan the QR code. This tells the app which type of test you are taking.Collect your pee sample from the middle of your urine stream.Briefly dip the test strip into the sample so that the squares get wet, but no urine goes above the ‘MAX WET’ line.Let the app countdown timer tell you when it's time to remove your strip from the sample and ready to scan.Still holding the test strip at the top, scan the test strip. The app will help you align the test strip correctly within the lines and what you need to do next.Your results will be displayed on the app screen and you can choose to share them with a healthcare professional if you want to. You will be given 1 of the 3 possible test results:High possibility – you are very likely to have a UTI.Possible UTI – the test has detected that you might have a UTI.Negative – no UTI has been detected in your urine.If you have a ‘possible UTI’ or ‘high possibility’ of having a UTI, you may be able to get treatment from ZAVA.",
